<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>Fiction—to adapt a famous definition of law—is the
meeting-point of Life and Art. Life is like a blind
and limitless expanse of sky, for ever dividing into tiny
drops of circumstances that rain down, thick and fast,
on the just and unjust alike. Art is like the dauntless,
plastic force that builds up stubborn, amorphous
substance cell by cell, into the frail geometry of a shell.
These two things are poles apart—how are they to meet
in the same work of fiction?</p>

<p>One way is to fling down, <i>pêle-mêle</i>, a handful of
separate acts and words, and then to turn on them the
constructive force of a human consciousness that will
arrange them into the pattern of logic or of drama.</p>

<p>Thus, in this book, Madeleine sees the trivial, disorderly
happenings of her life as a momentous battle
waged between a kindly Power who had written on
tablets of gold before the world began that she should
win her heart’s desire, and a sterner and mightier
Power who had written on tablets of iron that all her
hopes should be frustrated, so that, finally, naked and
bleeding, she might turn to Him. And having this
conception of life all her acquaintances become minor
<i>daimones</i>, friendly or hostile, according as they seem
to serve one power or the other.</p>

<p>The other way is to turn from time to time upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
action the fantastic limelight of eternity, with a sudden
effect of unreality and the hint of a world within a
world. My plot—that is to say, the building of the
shell—takes place in this inner world and is summed
up in the words that dog the dreams of Madeleine—<i>per
hunc in invisibilium amorem rapiamur</i>. In the outer
world there is nothing but the ceaseless, meaningless
drip of circumstances, in the inner world—a silent,
ineluctable march towards a predestined climax.</p>

<p>I have had the epilogue printed in italics to suggest
that the action has now moved completely on to the
stage of the inner world. In the outer world Madeleine
might with time have jettisoned the perilous stuff of
youth and have sailed serenely the rough, fresh sea of
facts. In the inner world, there was one thing and
one thing only that could happen to her: life is the
province of free-will, art the province of fate.</p>

</div>

<p>In the middle of the seventeenth century a family
called Troqueville came from Lyons to settle in Paris.
Many years before, Monsieur Troqueville had been one
of the four hundred <i>procureurs</i> of the Palais de Justice.
There were malicious rumours of disgraceful and
Bacchic scenes in Court which had led to his ejection
from that respectable body. Whether the rumours
were true or not, Monsieur Troqueville had long ceased
to be a Paris <i>procureur</i>, and after having wandered
about from town to town, he had at last settled in
Lyons, where by ‘devilling’ for a lawyer, writing
bombastic love-letters for shop apprentices, and playing
Lasquinet with country bumpkins, he managed to earn
a precarious livelihood. When, a few months before
the opening of this story, he had been suddenly seized
with a feverish craving to return to Paris ‘and once
more wear the glove of my lady Jurisprudence in the
tournay of the law-courts,’ as he put it, his wife had
regarded him with a frigid and sceptical surprise, as
she had long since given up trying to kindle in him one
spark of ambition. However, Madeleine, their only
child, a girl of seventeen, expressed such violent despair
and disappointment when Madame Troqueville pronounced
her husband’s scheme to be vain and impracticable,
that finally to Paris they came—for to her
mother, Madeleine’s happiness was the only thing of
any moment.</p>

<p>They had taken rooms above a baker’s shop in the
petite rue du Paon, in the East end of the University<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
quarter—the <i>Pays Latin</i>, where, for many centuries,
turbulent abstract youth had celebrated with Bacchic
orgies the cherub Contemplation, and strutting,
ragged and debonair on the razor’s edge of most
unprofitable speculation, had demonstrated to the
gaping, well-fed burghers, that the intellect had
its own heroisms and its own virtues. At that time
it was a neighbourhood of dark, winding little streets,
punctuated by the noble fabrics of colleges and
monasteries, and the open spaces of their fields and
gardens—a symbol, as it were, of contemporary
learning, where crabbed scholasticism still held its
own beside the spacious theories of Descartes and
Gassendi.</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville had inherited a small fortune
from her father, which made it possible to tide over
the period until her husband found regular employment.</p>

<p>She was by birth and upbringing a Parisian, her father
having been a Président de la Chambre des Comptes.
As the daughter of a Judge, she was a member of ‘la
Noblesse de Robe,’ the name given to the class of the
high dignitaries of the <i>Parlement</i>, who, with their scarlet
robes, their ermine, and their lilies, their Latin periods
and the portentous solemnity of their manner, were
at once ridiculous and awful.</p>

<p>It cannot be wondered at that on her return to
Paris she shrank from renewing relations with old friends
whose husbands numbered their legal posts by the
score and who drove about in fine coaches, ruthlessly
bespattering humble pedestrians with the foul mud of
Paris. But for Madeleine’s sake she put her pride in
her pocket, and though some ignored her overtures,
others welcomed her back with genial condescension.</p>

<p>The day that this story begins, the Troquevilles were
going to dine with the celebrated Madame Pilou, famous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
in ‘la Cour et la Ville’ for her homespun wit and
remarkably ill-favoured countenance—it would be
difficult to say of which of these two distinctions she
was most proud herself. Her career had been a social
miracle. Though her husband had been only a small
attorney, there was not a Princess or Duchess who did
not claim her as an intimate friend, and many a word
of counsel had she given to the Regent herself.</p>

<p>None of her mother’s old acquaintanceships did
Madeleine urge her so eagerly to renew as the one with
Madame Pilou. In vain her mother assured her that
she was just a coarse, ugly old woman.</p>

<p>‘So also are the Three Fates,’ said Jacques Tronchet
(a nephew of Madame Troqueville, who had come to
live with them), and Madeleine had looked at him,
surprised and startled.</p>

<p>Madame Pilou dined at midday, so Monsieur Troqueville
and Jacques were to go to her house direct from
the Palais de Justice independently of Madame Troqueville
and Madeleine. Madeleine had been ready a full
half-hour before it was time to start. She had sat in
the little parlour for a quarter of an hour absolutely
motionless. She was dressed in her best clothes, a
bodice of crimson serge, and an orange petticoat of
<i>camelot de Hollande</i>, the slender purse’s substitute for
silk. A gauze neckerchief threw a transparent veil over
the extreme <i>décolletage</i> of her bodice. On her head was
one of the new-fashioned <i>ténèbres</i>, a square of black
crape that tied under her chin, and took the place of a
hat. She wore a velvet mask and patches, in spite of
the Sumptuary Laws, which would reserve them for
ladies of rank, and from behind the mask her clear
gray eyes, that never smiled and seldom blinked, looked
out straight in front of her. Her hands were folded on
her lap. She had a remarkable gift for absolute stillness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>At the end of a quarter of an hour, she went to her
mother, who was preparing a cress salad in the kitchen,
and said in a quiet, tense voice:—</p>

<p>‘Maybe you would liefer not go to Madame Pilou’s
this morning. If so, tell me, and I will abandon it,’
then, with a sudden access of fury, ‘You will make me
hate you—you are for ever sacrificing matters of moment
to trifles. An you were to weigh the matter rightly,
my having some pleasure when I was young would
seem of greater moment than there being a salad for
supper!’</p>

<p>‘Madame Pilou dines at twelve, and it is but a bare
half-hour from our house to hers, and it is now eleven,’
Madame Troqueville answered slowly, emphasising each
word. ‘But we will start now without fail, if ’tis your
wish, and arrive like true Provincials half an hour before
we are due;’ irritation now made the words come
tumbling out, one on the top of the other. Madeleine
began to smile, and her mother went on with some
heat, but no longer with irritation.</p>

<p>‘But why in the name of Jesus do you lash yourself
into so strange a humour before going to old
Madame Pilou’s? One would think you were off to
the Palais Cardinal to wait on the Regent! She is but
a plain old woman; now if she were very learned,
or——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, mother, let her be, and go and make your
toilette,’ and Madame Troqueville went off obediently
to her room.</p>

<p>Madeleine paced about like a restive horse until
her mother was ready, but did not dare to disturb her
while she was dressing. It used to surprise Madeleine
that she should take such trouble over such unfashionable
toilettes.</p>

<p>It was not long before she came in quite ready. She
began to put Madeleine’s collar straight, which, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
some reason, annoyed Madeleine extremely. At last
they were out of the house.</p>

<p>Madame Pilou lived on the other side of the river,
in the rue Saint Antoine, so there was a good walk
before Madeleine and her mother, and judging from
Madeleine’s gloomy, abstracted expression, it did not
promise to be a very cheerful one.</p>

<p>They threaded their way into the rue des Augustins,
a narrow, cloistered street flanked on the left by the
long flat walls of the Monastery, over which were wafted
the sound of bells and the scent of early Spring. It
led straight out on to the Seine and the peaceful bustle
of its still rustic banks. They crossed it by the Pont-Neuf,
that perennial Carnival of all that Paris held of
most picturesque and most disreputable. The bombastic
eloquence of the quacks extolling their panaceas
and rattling their necklaces of teeth; the indescribable
foulness of the topical songs in which hungry-looking
bards celebrated to sweet ghostly airs of Couperin and
Cambert the last practical joke played by the Court
on the Town, or the latest extravagance of Mazarin;
the whining litany of the beggars; the plangent shrieks
of strange shrill birds caught in American forests—all
these sounds fell unheard on at least one pair of
ears.</p>

<p>On they hurried, past the booths of the jugglers and
comedians and the stalls of the money-lenders, past
the bronze equestrian statue of Henri IV., watching
with saturnine benevolence the gambols of the Gothic
vagabonds he had loved so dearly in life, cynically
indifferent to the discreet threats of his rival the water-house
of the Samaritaine, which, classical and chaste,
hinted at a future little to the taste of the <i>Vert Gallant</i>
and his vagabonds.</p>

<p>From time to time Madame Troqueville glanced
timidly at Madeleine but did not like to break the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
silence. At last, as they walked down the right bank
of the Seine, the lovely town at once substantial and
aerial, taking the Spring as blithely as a meadow,
filled her with such joy that she cried out:—</p>

<p>‘’Tis a delicate town, Paris! Are not you glad we
came, my pretty one?’</p>

<p>‘Time will show if there be cause for gladness,’
Madeline answered gloomily.</p>

<p>‘There goes a fine lady! I wonder what Marquise
or Duchesse she may be!’ cried Madame Troqueville,
wishing to distract her. Madeleine smiled scornfully.</p>

<p>‘No one of any note. Did you not remark it was a
<i>hired</i> coach? “<i>Les honnêtes gens</i>” do not sacrifice
to Saint Fiacre.’</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville gave rather a melancholy little
smile, but her own epigram had restored Madeleine,
for the time being, to good humour. They talked
amicably together for a little, and then again fell into
silence, Madeleine wearing a look of intense concentration.</p>

<p>Madame Pilou’s house was on the first floor above the
shop of a laundress. They were shown into her bedroom,
the usual place of reception in those days. The
furniture was of walnut, in the massive style of Henri
IV., and covered with mustard-coloured serge. Heavy
curtains of moquette kept out the light and air, and
enabled the room to preserve what Madeleine called
the ‘bourgeois smell.’ On the walls, however, was some
fine Belgian tapestry, on which was shown, with macabre
Flemish realism, the Seven Stations of the Cross. It
had been chosen by the son Robert, who was fanatically
devout.</p>

<p>Madame Pilou, dressed in a black dressing-gown
lined with green plush, and wearing a chaperon (a sort
of cap worn in the old days by every bourgeoise, but
by that time rarely seen), was lying on the huge carved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
bed. Her face, with its thick, gray beard, looming
huge and weather-beaten from under the tasselled
canopy, was certainly very ugly, but its expression was
not unpleasing. Monsieur Troqueville and Jacques had
already arrived. Monsieur Troqueville was a man of
about fifty, with a long beard in the doctor’s mode, a
very long nose, and small, excited blue eyes, like a
child’s. Jacques was rather a beautiful young man;
he was tall and slight, and had a pale, pointed face and
a magnificent chevelure of chestnut curls, and his light
eyes slanting slightly up at the corners gave him a
Faun-like look. He was a little like Madeleine, but he
had a mercurial quality which was absent in her.
Robert Pilou was there too, standing before the chimney-piece;
he was dressed in a very rusty black garment,
made to look as much like a priest’s cassock as possible.
Jacques said that with his spindly legs and red nose
and spectacles, he was exactly like old Gaultier-Garguille,
a famous actor of farce at the theatre of the Hôtel de
Bourgogne, and as the slang name for the Hôtel de
Bourgogne was, for some unknown reason, the ‘Pois-Pilés,’
Jacques, out of compliment to Robert’s appearance
and Madame Pilou’s beard, called their house the
‘Poil-Pilou.’</p>

<p>They were all sipping glasses of Hippocras and eating
preserved fruit. Jacques caught Madeleine’s eyes as
she came in. His own slanting green ones were dancing
with pleasure, he was always in a state of suppressed
amusement at the Pilous, but there was no answering
merriment in Madeleine’s eyes. She gave one quick
look round the room, and her face fell.</p>

<p>‘Well, my friends, you are exceeding welcome!’
bellowed Madame Pilou in the voice of a Musketeer.
‘I am overjoyed at seeing you, and so is Robert Pilou.’
Robert went as red as a turkey-cock, and muttered
something about ‘any one who comes to the house.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
‘You see I have to say his <i>fleurettes</i> for him, and he
does my praying for me; ’tis a bargain, isn’t it, Maître
Robert?’ Robert looked as if he were going to have
a fit with embarrassment, while Monsieur Troqueville
bellowed with laughter, and exclaimed, ‘Good! good!
excellent!’ then spat several times to show his approval.
(This habit of his disgusted Madeleine: ‘He doesn’t
even spit high up on the wall like a grand seigneur,’
she would say peevishly.)</p>

<p>‘Robert Pilou, give the ladies some Hippocras—Oh!
I insist on your trying it. My apothecary sends me a
bottle every New Year; it’s all I ever get out of him,
though he gets enough out of me with his draughts
and clysters!’ This sally was also much appreciated
by Monsieur Troqueville.</p>

<p>Robert Pilou grudgingly helped each of them to as
much Hippocras as would fill a thimble, and then sat
down on the chair farthest removed from Madame
Troqueville and Madeleine.</p>

<p>When the Hippocras had been drunk, Madame Pilou
bellowed across to him: ‘Now, Robert Pilou, it would
be civil in you to show the young lady your screen.
He has covered a screen with sacred woodcuts, and the
design is most excellently conceived,’ she added in a
proud aside to Madame Troqueville. ‘No, no, young
man, you sit down, I’m not going to have the poor
fellow made a fool of,’ as Jacques got up to follow the
other two into an adjoining closet. ‘But you, Troqueville,
I think it might be accordant with your humour—you
can go.’ Monsieur Troqueville, always ready to
think himself flattered, threw a look of triumph at
Jacques and went into the closet.</p>

<p>Madeleine was gazing at Robert with a look of rapt
attention in her large, grave eyes, while he expounded
the mysteries of his design. ‘You see,’ he said, turning
solemnly to Monsieur Troqueville, ‘I have so disposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the prints that they make an allegorical history of the
Fronde and——’</p>

<p>‘An excellent invention!’ cried Monsieur Troqueville,
all ready to be impressed, and at the same time to show
his own cleverness. ‘Were you a Frondeur yourself?’</p>

<p>Robert Pilou drew himself up stiffly. ‘No, Monsieur,
<i>I—was—not</i>. I was for the King and the Cardinal.
Well, as I was saying, profane history is countenanced
if told by means of sacred prints and moreover itself
becomes sacred history.’ Monsieur Troqueville clapped
his hands delightedly.</p>

<p>‘In good earnest it does,’ he cried, ‘and sacred history
becomes profane in the same way—’tis but a matter
of how you look at it—why, you could turn the life
of Jesus into the history of Don Quixote—a picture of
the woman who pours the ointment on his feet could
pass for the grand lady who waits on Don Quixote in
her castle, and the Virgin could be his niece——’</p>

<p>‘Here you have a print of Judas Iscariot,’ Robert
went on, having looked at Monsieur Troqueville suspiciously.
‘You observe he is a hunchback, and therefore
can be taken for the Prince de Conti!’ He looked
round triumphantly.</p>

<p>Madeleine said sympathetically, ‘’Tis a most happy
comparison!’ but Monsieur Troqueville was smiling
and nodding to himself, much too pleased with his own
idea to pay any attention to Robert’s.</p>

<p>‘And here we have the Cardinal! By virtue of his
holy office I need not find a sacred symbol for him, I
just give his own portrait. This, you see, is St Michael
fighting with the Dragon——’</p>

<p>‘Why, that would do most excellently for Don
Quixote fighting with the windmills!’</p>

<p>‘Father, I beseech you, no more!’ whispered
Madeleine severely.</p>

<p>‘But why? My conceit is every whit as good as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
his!’ said Monsieur Troqueville sulkily. Fortunately
Robert Pilou was too muddle-headed and too wrapt
up in himself to understand very clearly what other
people were talking about, so he went on:—</p>

<p>‘It is a symbol of the King’s party fighting with the
Frondeurs. Now here is a picture of a Procession of
the Confrérie de la Passion; needless to say, it shadows
forth the triumphant entry of the King and Cardinal
into Paris—you see the banners and the torches—’tis
an excellent symbol. And here you have a picture of
the stonemasons busy at the new buildings of Val de
Grâce, that is a double symbol—it stands for the work
of the King and Cardinal in rebuilding the kingdom;
it also stands for the gradual re-establishment of the
power of the Church. And this first series ends up
with this’—and he pointed gleefully to a horrible
picture of Dives in Hell—‘this stands for the Prince
de Condé in prison. And now we come to the second
series——;’ but just then Madame Pilou called them
back to the other room.</p>

<p>‘It is a most sweet invention!’ said Madeleine in her
low, soft voice, meeting Jacques’s twinkle with unruffled
gravity.</p>

<p>‘A most excellent, happy conceit! but I would fain
tell you the notion it has engendered in <i>my</i> mind!’
cried Monsieur Troqueville, all agog for praise.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I was of opinion it would accord with your
humour,’ nodded Madame Pilou, with rather a wicked
twinkle.</p>

<p>‘But what was <i>your</i> notion, Uncle?’ asked Jacques,
his mouth twitching.</p>

<p>‘Well, ’tis this way——’ began Monsieur Troqueville
excitedly, but Madeleine felt that she would faint
with boredom if her father were given an innings, so
turned the attention of the company to the workmanship
of a handsome clock on the chimney-piece.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, for Robert that clock is what the “Messieurs de
Port Royal” (coxcombs all of them, <i>I</i> say!) would call
the <i>grace efficace</i>, in that by preventing him from
being late for Mass it saves his soul from Hell!’
said Madame Pilou, looking at her son, who nodded
his head in solemn confirmation. Jacques shot a
malicious glance at Madeleine, who was looking rather
self-conscious.</p>

<p>‘Now, then, Monsieur Jacques,’ went on Madame
Pilou, thoroughly enjoying herself. ‘You are a learned
young man, and sustained your thesis in philosophy
at the University, do you hold it can be so ordered that
one person can get another into Paradise—in short, that
one can be pious by proxy?’</p>

<p>‘Madame Pilou!’ piped Robert plaintively, flapping
his arms as though they had been wings, then he crossed
himself and pulled his face back into its usual expression
of stolidity.</p>

<p>‘Because,’ went on Madame Pilou, paying not the
slightest attention to him, ‘it would be much to my
liking if Robert could do all my church-going for me;
I was within an ace of fetching up my dinner at Mass
last Sunday, the stench was so exceeding powerful. I
am at a loss to know why people are wont to smell
worse in Church than anywhere else!’</p>

<p>‘I suppose that is what is called the odour of sanctity,’
said Jacques, with his engaging grin, looking at Madeleine
to see if she was amused. Both Madeleine and Madame
Troqueville smiled, but Robert was so busy seeing how
long he could keep his cheeks blown out without letting
out the breath that he did not hear, and Monsieur
Troqueville was so occupied with planning how he
could go one better that he had no time to smile.
Jacques’s sally, however, displeased Madame Pilou
extremely. She was really very devout in the sane
fashion of the old Gallican Church, and though she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
herself might make profane jokes, she was not going
to allow them in a very young man.</p>

<p>‘Odour of sanctity indeed!’ she cried angrily. ‘I
warrant <i>you</i> don’t smell any better than your neighbours,
young man!’ a retort which made up in vehemence
what it lacked in point. Monsieur Troqueville
roared with delight and Jacques made a face. He had
a wonderful gift for making faces.</p>

<p>‘Impudent fellow! One would think your face was
Tabarin’s hat by the shapes you twist it into! Anyway,
you have more sense in your little finger than your
uncle has in his whole body! and while we are on the
matter of his shortcomings, I would fain know the
<i>true</i> motive of his leaving Lyons?’ and she shot a
malicious look at the discomfited Monsieur Troqueville,
while Madame Troqueville went quite white with rage.
Fortunately, at this moment, the servant came to say
that dinner was ready, and they all moved into the large
kitchen, where, true to the traditions of the old bourgeoisie,
Madame Pilou always had her meals.</p>

<p>‘Well, well, Mademoiselle Marie, I dare swear you have
not found that Paris has gained one ounce of wisdom
during your sojourn in the provinces. Although the
<i>Prince des Sots</i> no longer enters the gates in state on
Mardi Gras, as was the custom in my young days, that
is not to say that Folly has been banished the town.
‘Do you frequent many of your old friends?’ bellowed
Madame Pilou, almost drowning the noise Monsieur
Troqueville and Robert were making over their soup.</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, they have proffered me a most kindly
welcome,’ Madame Troqueville answered not quite
truthfully.</p>

<p>‘Have you seen the Coigneux and the Troguins?’</p>

<p>‘We have much commerce with the Troguins.’</p>

<p>‘And has not the <i>désir de parroistre</i> been flourishing
finely since your day? All the Parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
families have got coats of arms from the herald Hozier
since then, and have them tattooed all over their bodies
like Chinamen.’</p>

<p>Monsieur Troqueville cocked an intelligent eye, he
was always on the outlook for interesting bits of
information.</p>

<p>‘And you must know that there are no <i>families</i>
nowadays, there are only “houses”! And they roll
their silver up and down the stairs, hoping by such
usage to give it the air of old family plate, instead of
eating off decent pewter as their fathers did before
them! And every year the judges grow vainer and
more extravagant—great heavy puffed-out sacks of
nonsense! There is <i>la cour</i> and <i>la ville</i>—and <i>la basse-cour</i>,
and that’s where the <i>gens de robe</i> live, and the
judges are the turkey-cocks!’ Every one laughed
except Robert Pilou. ‘And the sons with their plumes
and swords like young nobles, and the daughters who
would rather wear a velvet gown in Hell than a serge
one in Paradise put me in a strong desire to box their
ears!’</p>

<p>‘’Tis your turn now!’ Jacques whispered to Madeleine,
who was feeling terribly conscious of her mask and six
patches. However, Madame Pilou abruptly changed
the subject by turning to Madeleine and asking her
what she thought of Paris.</p>

<p>‘I think it is furiously beautiful,’ she answered, at
which Madame Pilou went off into a bellow of
laughter.</p>

<p>‘<i>Jésus!</i> Hark to the little Précieuse with her
“furiously”! So “furiously” has reached the provinces,
has it? Little Madeleine will be starting her
“<i>ruelle</i>” next! Ha! Ha!’ Madeleine blushed
crimson, Jacques looked distressed, Robert Pilou gave
a sudden wild whoop of laughter, then stopped dead,
looked anxiously round, and pulled a long face again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>‘That is news to me,’ Monsieur Troqueville began
intelligently; ‘is “furiously” much in use with the
Précieuses?’ but Madame Troqueville, who was very
indignant that Madeleine should be made fun of, broke
in hurriedly with, ‘I think my daughter learned it in
Mademoiselle de Scudéry’s <i>Grand Cyrus</i>; she liked it
rarely; we read it through together from beginning to
end.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I fear me, I cannot confess to the same
assiduity, and that though Mademoiselle de Scudéry
brought me the volumes herself,’ said Madame Pilou.
‘I promised her I would read it if she gave me her
word that that swashbuckler of a brother of hers should
not come to the house for six months, but there he was
that very evening, come to find out what I thought of
the description of the battle of Rocroy! Are you a
lover of reading, my child?’ suddenly turning to
Madeleine.</p>

<p>‘No, ’tis most distasteful to me,’ she answered
emphatically, to her mother’s complete stupefaction.</p>

<p>‘But Madeleine——’ she began. Madame Pilou,
however, cut her short with ‘Quite right, quite right,
my child. You’ll never learn anything worth the
knowing out of books. I have lived nearly eighty
years, and my Missal and Æsop his fables are near the
only two books I have ever read. What you can’t learn
from life itself is not worth the learning——’</p>

<p>‘But Madeleine has grown into such an excessive
humour for books, that she wholly addicts herself to
them!’ cried Madame Troqueville indignantly. She
was determined that an old barbarian like Madame
Pilou should not flatter herself she had anything in
common with her Madeleine. But Madame Pilou was
too busy talking herself to hear her.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle de Scudéry is writing a new romance,
she tells me (it’s all her, you know; Conrart tells me that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
all the writing in it that tedious, prolix, bombastic
fop of a brother does is to put his name to the title
page!) and she says that I am to be portrayed in it.
Poor Robert is in a sad taking; he thinks you
cannot be both in a romance and the Book of Life!’
Robert Pilou looked at his mother with the eyes of an
anxious dog, and she smiled at him encouragingly, and
assured him that there were many devotees described
in romances.</p>

<p>‘I dare swear she will limn me as a beautiful princess,
with Robert Pilou as my knight, or else I’ll be—what
d’ye call her—that heathen goddess, and Robert Pilou
will be my owl!’</p>

<p>Madeleine had been strangely embarrassed for the last
few minutes. When she was nervous the sound of her
father’s voice tortured her, and feeling the imminence
of a favourite story of his about an old lady of
Lyons, called Madame Hibou, who had found her
gardener drunk in her bed, she felt she would go mad
if she had to listen to it again, so to stop him, she said
hurriedly, ‘Could you tell us, Madame, whom some
of the characters in the <i>Grand Cyrus</i> are meant to
depict?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! every one is there, every one of the Court
and the Town. I should be loath to have you think I
wasted my time in reading all the dozen volumes, but
I cast my eye through some of them, and I don’t hold
with dressing up living men and women in all these
outlandish clothes and giving them Grecian names.
It’s like the quacks on the Pont-Neuf, who call themselves
“Il Signor Hieronymo Ferranti d’Orvieto,” and
such like, though they are only decent French burghers
like the rest of us!’</p>

<p>‘Or might it not be more in the nature of duchesses
masquerading at the Carnival as Turkish ladies and
shepherdesses?’ suggested Madeleine in a very nervous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
voice, her face quite white, as though she were a young
Quakeress, bearing testimony for the first time.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, I dare swear that conceit would better please
the demoiselle,’ said Madame Pilou good-humouredly.
‘But it isn’t only in romances that we aren’t called
by our good calendar names—oh, no, you are baptized
Louise, or Marie, or Marguerite, but if you want to be
in the mode, you must call yourself Amaryllis, or
Daphne, or Phillis,’ and Madame Pilou minced out the
names, her huge mouth pursed up. ‘I tell them that it
is only actors and soldiers—the scum of the earth—who
take fancy names. No, no, I am quite out of patience
with the present fashion of beribboning and beflowering
the good wood of life, as if it were a great maypole.’</p>

<p>‘And I am clearly on the other side!’ cried Madame
Troqueville hotly, ‘I would have every inch of the
hard wood bedecked with flowers!’</p>

<p>‘Well, well, Marie, life has dealt hardly with you,’
said Madame Pilou, throwing a menacing look at
Monsieur Troqueville, ‘but life and I have ever been
good friends; and the cause may be that we are not
unlike one to the other, both strong and tough, and
with little tomfoolery about us.’ Madame Troqueville
gazed straight in front of her, her eyes for the moment
as chill as Madeleine’s. This was more than she could
stand, she, the daughter of an eminent judge, to be
pitied by this coarse old widow of an attorney.</p>

<p>‘Maybe the reason you have found life not unkind
is because you are not like the dog in the fable,’ said
Madeleine shyly, ‘who lost the substance out of greediness
to possess the shadow.’</p>

<p>Madame Pilou was delighted. Any reference to
Æsop’s fables was sure to please her, for it brought her
the rare satisfaction of recognising a literary allusion.</p>

<p>‘That is very prettily said, my child,’ and she
chuckled with glee. Then she looked at Madeleine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
meditatively. ‘But see here, as you are so enamoured
of the <i>Grand Cyrus</i>, you had better come some day and
make the acquaintance of Mademoiselle de Scudéry.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Madeleine, you would like that rarely, would you
not?’ cried Madame Troqueville, flushing with pleasure.</p>

<p>But Madeleine had gone deadly white, and stammered
out, ‘Oh—er—I am vastly obliged, Madame, but in
truth I shouldn’t ... the honour would put me out
of countenance.’</p>

<p>‘Out of countenance? Pish! Pish! my child,’
laughed Madame Pilou, ‘Mademoiselle de Scudéry is
but a human being like the rest of us, she eats and
drinks and is bled and takes her purges like any one
else. Yes, you come and see her, and convey yourself
towards her as if she were a <i>grande dame</i> who had
never seen a goose’s quill in her life, and you will gain
her friendship on the spot.’</p>

<p>‘The lady I would fainest in the world meet,’ said
Madeleine, and there was suppressed eagerness in her
voice, ‘is Madame de Rambouillet, she——’</p>

<p>‘My child, your wish has something in’t like rare
wit and sense,’ interrupted Madame Pilou warmly,
‘she is better worth seeing than anything else in the
world, than the Grand Turk or Prester John himself.’</p>

<p>‘Was it not the late Monsieur Voiture that said of
her, “I revere her as the most noble, the most beautiful,
and the most perfect thing I have ever seen”?’ said
Madeleine, the ordeal of quoting making her burn with
self-consciousness.</p>

<p>‘I dare say it was. Poor Voiture, he was an impudent
fellow, but his wit was as nimble as a hare. He always
put me in mind of a performer there used to be on the
Pont-Neuf—we called him the “Buveur d’Eau”—he
would fill his mouth with ordinary cold water and then
spout it out in cascades of different coloured scents.
Some trick, doubtless, but it was wonderful. And in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the same way Voiture would take some plain homespun
sentiment and twist it and paint it and madrigalise it
into something so fantastical that you would never
recognise it as the same.’</p>

<p>‘I remember me to have seen that “Buveur d’Eau”
when I came to Paris as a young man, and——’ began
Monsieur Troqueville, in whom for some time the
pleasures of the table had triumphed over the desire to
shine. But Madeleine was not going to let the conversation
wander to quacks and mountebanks. In a
clear, though gentle voice, she asked if it were true that
the Marquise de Rambouillet was in very delicate
health.</p>

<p>‘Yes, very frail but rarely in Paris nowadays.
The last time I went to see her she said, smiling as is
always her way, “I feel like a ghost in Paris these days,
a ghost that died hundreds of years ago,” and I much
apprehend that she will in sober earnest be a ghost
before long,’ and Madame Pilou, who was deeply moved,
blew her nose violently on a napkin.</p>

<p>‘She must be a lady of great and rare parts,’ said
Madame Troqueville sympathetically. The remark
about ‘feeling like a ghost’ had touched her imagination.</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed. She is the only virtuous woman I
have ever known who is a little ashamed of her virtue—and
that is perfection. There is but little to choose
between a prude and a whore, <i>I</i> think ... yes, I do,
Robert Pilou. Ay! in good earnest, she is of a most
absolute behaviour. The Marquis has no need to wear
<i>his</i> hair long. You know when this fashion for men
wearing love-locks came in, I said it was to hide the
horns!’</p>

<p>‘Do the horns grow on one’s neck, then?’ Jacques
asked innocently. Monsieur Troqueville was much
tickled, and Madame Troqueville wondered wearily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
how many jokes she had heard in her life about ‘horns’
and ‘cuckolds.’</p>

<p>‘Grow on one’s neck, indeed! You’ll find <i>that</i> out
soon enough, young man!’ snorted Madame Pilou.</p>

<p>The substantial meal was now over, and Monsieur
Troqueville had licked from his fingers the last crumbs
of the last <i>Pasté à la mazarinade</i>, when Robert Pilou,
who had been silent nearly all dinner-time, now said
slowly and miserably, ‘To appear in a romance! In
a romance with Pagans and Libertins! Oh! Madame
Pilou!’ His mother looked round proudly.</p>

<p>‘Hark to him! He has been pondering the matter;
he always gets there if you but give him time!’ and
she beamed with maternal pride. Then Madame
Troqueville rose and made her adieux, though Madeleine
looked at her imploringly, as if her fate hung upon her
staying a little longer. Madame Pilou was particularly
affectionate in her good-bye to Madeleine. ‘Well, we’ll
see if we can’t contrive it that you meet Madame de
Rambouillet.’</p>

<p>Madeleine’s face suddenly became radiantly happy.</p>

</div>

<p>At supper that evening Madeleine seemed intoxicated
with happiness. She laughed wildly at nothing and
squeezed Jacques’s hand under the table, which made
him look pleased but embarrassed. Monsieur Troqueville
was also excited about something, for he kept
smiling and muttering to himself, gesticulating now and
then, his nostrils expanding, his eyes flashing as if in
concert with his own unspoken words. Jacques burst
into extravagant praise of Madame Pilou, couched, as
was his way, in abrupt adjectives, ‘She is <i>crotesque</i>
... she is <i>gauloise</i> ... she is superb!’</p>

<p>‘My dear Jacques,’ said Madame Troqueville, smiling,
‘You would find dozens of women every whit as
<i>crotesque</i> and <i>gauloise</i> in the Halles. I’ll take you
with me when I go marketing some day.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, and I’ll settle down and build my harem
there and fill it with Madame Pilous,’ said he, grinning.
‘If I had lived in the days of Amadis de Gaul she should
have been my lady and I’d have worn ... a hair
shirt made of her beard!’</p>

<p>Madeleine, who did not, as a rule, much appreciate
Jacques’s wit, laughed long and excitedly. Her mother
looked at her, not sure whether to rejoice at or to fear
this sudden change from languid gloom. Jacques
went on with his jerky panegyric. ‘She is like some
one in Rabelais. She might have been the mother of
Gargantua, she——’</p>

<p>‘Gargamelle! Gargamelle was the mother of Gargantua!’
cried Madeleine eagerly and excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>‘As you will, Gargamelle, then. Why doesn’t she
please you, Aunt? It is you that are <i>really</i> the Précieuse,
and Madeleine is at heart a <i>franque gauloise</i>,’ and
he looked at Madeleine wickedly.</p>

<p>‘That I’m not ... you know nothing of my humour,
Jacques.... I know best about myself, I am abhorrent
of aught that is coarse and ungallant.... I am to
seek why you should make other people share your
faults, you——’ Madeleine had tears of rage in her
eyes.</p>

<p>‘You are a sprouting Madame Pilou, beard and all!’
teased Jacques. ‘No, you’re not,’ and he stopped
abruptly. It was his way suddenly to get bored
with a subject he had started himself.</p>

<p>‘But Madeleine,’ began Madame Troqueville, ‘what,
in Heaven’s name, prompted you to refuse to meet
Mademoiselle de Scutary?’</p>

<p>‘De S-c-u-d-é-r-y,’ corrected Madeleine, enunciating
each letter with weary irritation.</p>

<p>‘De Scudéry, then. You are such a goose, my child;
in the name of Our Lady, how <i>can</i> you expect——’
and Madame Troqueville began to work herself up
into a frenzy, such as only Madeleine was able to arouse
in her.</p>

<p>But Madeleine said with such earnestness, ‘Pray
mother, let the matter be,’ that Madame Troqueville
said no more.</p>

<p>Supper being over, Monsieur Troqueville, wearing an
abstracted, important air, took his hat and cloak and
went out, and Madame Troqueville went to her
spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>Jacques and Madeleine went up to her bedroom, to
which they retired nearly every evening, nominally to
play Spelequins or Tric-trac. Madame Troqueville
had her suspicions that little of the evening was spent
in these games, but what of that? Jacques’s mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
had left him a small fortune, not large enough to buy
a post in the <i>Parlement</i>, but still a competency, and if
Madeleine liked him they would probably be able to
get a dispensation, and Madame Troqueville would be
spared the distasteful task of negotiating for a husband
for her daughter. Her passion for Madeleine was not
as strong as a tendency to shudder away from action,
to sit spellbound and motionless before the spectacle
of the automatic movement of life.</p>

<p>Jacques was now learning to be an attorney, for
although his father had been an advocate, his friends
considered that he would have more chance on the other
side. Jacques docilely took their advice, for it was all
one to him whether he eventually became an advocate
or an attorney, seeing that from the clerks of both
professions were recruited ‘<i>les Clercs de la Bazoche</i>’—a
merry, lewd corporation with many a quaint gothic
custom that appealed to Jacques’s imagination.</p>

<p>They had a Chancellor—called King in the old days—whom
they elected annually from among themselves,
and who had complete authority over them. That
year Jacques reached the summit of his ambition, for
they chose him for the post.</p>

<p>He had never seen Madeleine till her arrival in Paris
two months before. At that time he was fanning the
dying embers of a passion for a little lady of the Pays-Latin
of but doubtful reputation.</p>

<p>Then the Troquevilles had arrived, and, to his horror,
he began to fall in love with Madeleine. Although
remarkably cynical for his age, he was nevertheless,
like all of his contemporaries, influenced by the high-flown
chivalry of Spain, elaborated by the Précieuses into a
code where the capital crime was to love more than
once. In consequence, he was extremely surly with
Madeleine at first and laid it on himself as a sacred
duty to find out one fault in her every day. Her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
solemnity was unleavened by one drop of the mocking
gaiety of France; in an age of plump beauties she
seemed scraggy; unlike his previous love, she was
slow and rather clumsy in her movements. But it was
in vain, and he had finally to acknowledge that she
was like one of the grave-eyed, thin-mouthed beauties
Catherine de Médici had brought with her from Italy,
that her very clumsiness had something beautiful and
virginal about it, and, in fact, that he was deeply in
love with her.</p>

<p>When he had told her of his new feelings towards
herself she had replied with a scorn so withering as to
be worthy of the most prudish Précieuse of the Marais.
This being so, his surprise was as great as his joy when,
about a week before the dinner described in the last
chapter, she announced that he ‘might take his fill of
kissing her, and that she loved him very much.’</p>

<p>So a queer little relationship sprang up between
them, consisting of a certain amount of kissing, a great
deal of affectionate teasing on Jacques’s side, endless
discussions of Madeleine’s character and idiosyncrasies—a
pastime which never failed to delight and interest
her—and a tacit assumption that they were betrothed.</p>

<p>But Jacques was not the gallant that Madeleine
would have chosen. In those days, the first rung of
the social ladder was <i>le désir de parroistre</i>—the wish
to make a splash and to appear grander than you really
were—and this noble aspiration of ‘<i>une âme bien née</i>’
was entirely lacking in Jacques. Then his scorn of the
subtleties of Dandyism was incompatible with being
<i>un honnête homme</i>, for though his long ringlets were
certainly in the mode, they had originally been a concession
to his mother, and all Madeleine’s entreaties
failed to make him discard his woollen hose and his
jerkin of Holland cloth, or substitute top boots for his
short square shoes. Nor did he conform in his wooing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
to the code of the modish Cupid and hire the Four
Fiddles to serenade her, or get up little impromptu
balls in her honour, or surprise collations coming as a
graceful climax to a country walk. Madeleine had too
fine a scorn for facts to allow the knowledge of his lack
of means to extenuate this negligence.</p>

<p>In short, the fact could not be blinked that Jacques
was ignoble enough to be quite content with being a
bourgeois.</p>

<p>Then again, in Metaphysics, Jacques held very
different views from Madeleine, for he was an Atheistic
follower of Descartes and a scoffer at Jansenism, while
in other matters he was much in sympathy with the
‘Libertins’—the sworn foes of the Précieuses. The
name of ‘Libertin’ was applied—in those days with no
pornographic connotation—to the disciples of Gassendi,
Nandé, and La Motte le Vayer. These had evolved a
new Epicurean philosophy, to some of their followers
merely an excuse for witty gluttony, to others, a potent
ethical incentive. The Précieuses, they held, had
insulted by the diluted emotions and bombastic language
their good goddess Sens Commun, who had caught
for them some of the radiance of the Greek Σωφροσύνη.
One taste, however, they shared with the Précieusues,
and that was the love of the <i>crotesque</i>—of quaint,
cracked brains and deformed, dwarfish bodies, and of
colouring. It was the same tendency probably that
produced a little earlier the architecture known as
<i>baroque</i>, the very word <i>crotesque</i> suggesting the
mock stalactitic grottoes with which these artists had
filled the gardens of Italy. But this very thing was
being turned by the Libertins, with unconscious irony,
<i>via</i> the <i>genre burlesque</i> of the Abbé Scarron, into a sturdy
Gallic realism—for first studying real life in quest of the
<i>crotesque</i>, they fell in love with its other aspects too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>Madeleine resented that Jacques continued just as
interested in his own life as before he had met her—in
his bright-eyed vagabondage in Bohemia, his quest
after absurdities on the Pont-Neuf and in low taverns.
She hated to be reminded that there could be anything
else in the world but herself. But in spite of her evident
disapproval, he continued to spend just as much of his
time in devising pranks with his subjects of La Bazoche,
and in haunting the Pont-Neuf in quest of the <i>crotesque</i>.</p>

<p>Another thing which greatly displeased Madeleine
was that Jacques and her father had struck up a boon-companionship,
and this also she was not able to stop.</p>

<p>That same evening, when they got into her room, they
were silent for a little. Jacques always left it to her to
give the note of the evening’s intimacy.</p>

<p>‘What are you pondering?’ he said at last.</p>

<p>‘’Twould be hard to say, Jacques.... I’m exceeding
happy.’</p>

<p>‘Are you? I’m glad of it! you have been of so
melancholy and strange a humour ever since I’ve known
you. There were times when you had the look of a
hunted thing.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, at times my heart was like to break with
melancholy.’</p>

<p>Jacques was silent, then he said suddenly, ‘Has it
aught to do with that Scudéry woman?’</p>

<p>Madeleine gave a start and blushed all over. ‘What
... what ... how d’you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! I don’t know. I had the fancy it might in
some manner refer to her ... you act so whimsically
when mention is made of her.’</p>

<p>Madeleine laughed nervously, and examined her
nails with unnecessary concentration, and then with
eyes still averted from Jacques, she began in a jerky,
embarrassed voice, ‘I’m at a loss to know how you
discovered it ... ’tis so foolish, at least, I mean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
rather ’tis so hard to make my meaning clear ... but
to say truth, it <i>is</i> about her ... the humour to know
her has come so furiously upon me <i>that I shall go mad
if it cannot be compassed</i>!’ and her voice became
suddenly hard and passionate.</p>

<p>‘There is no reason in nature why it should not. Old
Pilou said she would contrive it for you, but you acted
so fantastically and begged her not to, funny one!’</p>

<p>Madeleine once more became self-conscious. ‘I know
... it’s so hard to make clear my meaning.... ’Tis
an odd, foolish fancy, I confess, but I am always having
the feeling that things won’t fall out as I would wish,
except something else happens first. As soon as the
desire for a thing begins to work on me, all manner of
little fantastical things crop up around me, and I am
sensible that except I compound with them I shall
not compass the big thing. For example ... for
example, if I was going to a ball and was eager it should
prove a pleasant junketing, well, I might feel it was
going to yield but little pleasure unless—unless—I
were able to keep that comb there balanced on my
hand while I counted three.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t!’ cried Jacques, clasping his head despairingly.
‘I shall get the contagion.... I <i>know</i> I shall!’</p>

<p>‘Well, anyway,’ she went on wearily, ‘I was seized
by the notion that ... that ... that it wouldn’t
... that I wouldn’t do so well with Mademoiselle de
Scudéry unless I met her for the first time at the Hôtel
de Rambouillet, and it <i>must</i> be there, and if the Marquise
be of so difficult access, perchance it can’t be compassed....
Oh! I would I were dead,’ the last words came
tumbling out all in one breath.</p>

<p>‘Poor little Chop!’ said Jacques sympathetically.
(It was the fashion, brought to Paris by the exiled
King of England, to call pets by English names, and
Jacques had heard a bulldog called ‘Chop,’ and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
so tickled by the name, that he insisted on giving it to
Madeleine that he might have the pleasure of often
saying it).</p>

<p>‘’Tis a grievous thing to want anything sorely. But
I am confident the issue will be successful.’</p>

<p>‘Are you? Are you?’ she cried, her face lighting up.
‘When do you think the meeting will take place?
Madame de Rambouillet is always falling ill.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Old Pilou can do what she will with all those
great folk, and she has conceived a liking for you.’</p>

<p>‘Has she? Has she? How do you know? What
makes you think so?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t know ... however, she has,’ he
answered, suddenly getting distrait. ‘Is it truly but
as an exercise against the spleen that you pass whole
hours in leaping up and down the room?’ he asked
after a pause, watching her curiously.</p>

<p>Madeleine blushed, and answered nervously:—</p>

<p>‘Yes, ’tis good for the spleen—the doctor told me
so—also, if you will, ’tis a caprice——’</p>

<p>‘How ravishing to be a woman!’ sighed Jacques.
‘One can be as great a <i>visionnaire</i> as one will and be
thought to have rare parts withal, whereas, if a man
were to pass his time in cutting capers up and down
the room, he’d be shut up in <i>les petites maisons</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> How
comes it that you want to know Mademoiselle Scudéry
more than any one else?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot say, ’tis just that I do, and the wish has
worked so powerfully on my fancy that ’tis become
my only thought. It has grown from a little fancy
into a huge desire. ’Tis like to a certain nightmare
I sometimes have when things swell and swell.’</p>

<p>‘When things swell and swell?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, ’tis what I call my Dutch dream, for it ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
begins by my being surrounded by divers objects, such
as cheeses and jugs and strings of onions and lutes
and spoons, as in a Dutch picture, and I am sensible
that one of them presently, I never know which ’twill
be, will start to swell. And then on a sudden one of
them begins, and it is wont to continue until I feel
that if it get any bigger I shall go mad. And in
like manner, I hold it to be but chance that it was
Mademoiselle de Scudéry that took to swelling, it might
quite well have been any one else.’</p>

<p>Jacques smiled a little. ‘It might always quite well
have been any one else,’ he said.</p>

<p>Madeleine looked puzzled for a minute and then
went on unhappily, ‘I feel ’tis all so unreal, just a
“vision.” Oh! How I wish it was something in
accordance with other people’s experiences ... something
they could understand, such as falling in love,
for example, but this——’</p>

<p>‘It isn’t the cause that is of moment, you know,
it’s the strength of the “passion” resulting from the
cause. And in truth I don’t believe any one <i>could</i> have
been subject to a stronger “passion” than you since you
have come to Paris.’</p>

<p>‘So it doesn’t seem to you extravagant then?’ she
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Only as all outside one’s own desires do seem extravagant.’
He sat down beside her and drew her rather
timidly to him. ‘I’m confident ’twill right itself in the
end, Chop,’ he whispered. She sprang up eagerly, her
eyes shining.</p>

<p>‘Do you think so, Jacques ... in sober earnest?’</p>

<p>‘Come back, Chop!’ In Jacques’s eyes there was
what Madeleine called the ‘foolish expression,’ which
sooner or later always appeared when he was alone
with her. It bored her extremely; why could he not
be content with spending the whole time in rational<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
talk? However, she went back with a sigh of resignation.</p>

<p>After a few minutes she said with a little excited
giggle, ‘What do you think ... er ... Mademoiselle
de Scudéry will think of me?’</p>

<p>Jacques only grunted, the ‘foolish expression’ still
in his eyes.</p>

<p>‘Jacques!’ she cried sharply, ‘tell me!’ and she
got up.</p>

<p>‘What will she think of you? Oh! that you’re an
ill-favoured, tedious little imp.’</p>

<p>‘No, Jacques!’</p>

<p>‘A scurvy, lousy, bombastic——’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Jacques, forbear, for God’s sake!’</p>

<p>‘Provincial——’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Jacques, no more, I’ll <i>scream</i> till you hold
your tongue ... <i>what</i> will she think of me, in sober
earnest?’</p>

<p>‘She’ll think——’ and he stopped, and looked at her
mischievously. Her lips were moving, as if repeating
some formulary. ‘That you are ... that there is a
“I know not what about you of gallant and witty.”’
Madeleine began to leap up and down the room, then
she rushed to Jacques and flung her arms round his neck.</p>

<p>‘I am furiously grateful to you!’ she cried. ‘I felt
that had you not said something of good omen ere I
had repeated “she’ll think” twenty times, I would
never compass my desires, and you said it when I had
got to eighteen times!’ Jacques smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>‘So you know the language she affects, do you?’ said
Madeleine, with a sort of self-conscious pride.</p>

<p>‘Alas! that I do! I read a few volumes of the
<i>Grand Cyrus</i>, and think it the saddest fustian——’</p>

<p>‘Madame Pilou said she had begun another ... do
you think ... er ... do you think ... that ...
maybe I’ll figure in it?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>‘’Tis most probable. Let’s see. “Chopine is one of
the most beautiful persons in the whole of Greece, as,
Madame, you will readily believe when I tell you that
she was awarded at the Cyprian Games the second
prize for beauty.”’ Madeleine blushed prettily, and gave
a little gracious conventional smile. She was imagining
that Mademoiselle de Scudéry herself was reading it
to her. ‘“The <i>first</i> prize went, of course, to that fair
person who, having learnt the art of thieving from
Mercury himself, proceeded to rob the Graces of all
their charms, the Muses of all their secrets. Like that
of the goddess Minerva, hers is, if I may use the expression,
a virile beauty, for on her chin is the thickest,
curliest, most Jove-like beard that has ever been seen
in Greece——”’</p>

<p>‘Jacques! it’s not——’</p>

<p>‘“Madame, your own knowledge of the world will tell
you that I speak of Madame Pilou!”’ Madeleine stamped
her foot, and her eyes filled with angry tears, but just
then there was a discreet knock at the door, and Berthe,
the Troqueville’s one servant, came in with a cup and a
jug of Palissy <i>faience</i>. She was fat and fair, with a
wall-eye and a crooked mouth. Her home was in
Lorraine, and she was a mine of curious country-lore,
but a little vein of irony ran through all her renderings
of local legends, and there was nothing she held in
veneration—not even ‘<i>la bonne Lorraine</i>’ herself. Her
tongue wagged incessantly, and Jacques said she was
like the servant girl, Iambe—‘the prattling daughter
of Pan.’ She had been with the Troquevilles only since
they had come to Paris, but she belonged to the class

She took a cynically benevolent interest in the relationship
between Jacques and Madeleine, and although
there was no need whatever for the rôle, she had
instituted herself the confidante and adviser of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
‘lovers,’ and from the secrecy and despatch with which
she would keep the two posted in each other’s movements,
Monsieur and Madame Troqueville might have
been the parental tyrants of a Spanish comedy. This
attitude irritated Madeleine extremely, but Jacques it
tickled and rather pleased.</p>

<p>‘Some Rossoli for Mademoiselle, very calming to the
stomach, in youth one needs such drafts, for the blood
is hot, he! he!’ and she nodded her head several
times, and smiled a smile which shut the wall-eye and
hitched up the crooked mouth. Then she came up to
them and whispered, ‘The master is not in yet, and the
mistress is busy with her spinning!’ and the strange
creature with many nods and becks set the jug and cup
on the table, and continuing to mutter encouragement,
marched out with soft, heavy steps.</p>

<p>Madeleine dismissed Jacques, saying she was tired
and wanted to go to bed.</p>

<p>It is wellnigh impossible for any one to be very
explicit about their own nerves, for there is something
almost indecently intimate in a nervous fear or
obsession. Thus, although Madeleine’s explanation to
Jacques had given her great relief, it had been but
partial. She would sooner have died than have told
him the real impulse, for instance, that sent her dancing
madly up and down the room, or have analysed minutely
her feelings towards Mademoiselle de Scudéry.</p>

<p>The seeds of the whole affair were, I think, to be
found in the fact that an ancestor of Madame Troqueville’s
had been an Italian lady of high family, who had
left a strain, fine, fastidious, civilised—in the morbid
way of Italy—to lie hidden in obscurity in the bourgeois
stock, and to crop up from time to time with pathetic
persistence, in a tragically aristocratic outlook, thin
features, and the high, narrow forehead that had given
to the pallid beauties of the sixteenth century a look
of <i>maladif</i> intellect.</p>

<p>To Madeleine it had also brought a yearning from
earliest childhood for a radiant, transfigured world,
the inhabitants of which seemed first of all to be the
rich merchant families of Lyons.</p>

<p>One of her most vivid memories was an occasion on
which a strolling company of players had acted a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
comedy in the house of a leader among these merchants,
a certain Maître Jean Prunier. Although the Troquevilles
personally did not know the Pruniers, they had
a common friend, and he had taken Madeleine and her
parents to the performance. They went into an enormous
room filled with benches, with a raised platform
at one end. The walls and the ceiling were frescoed
with various scenes symbolical of Maître Prunier’s
commercial prowess. He was shown riding on woolly
waves on the back of a dolphin, presenting a casket of
gloves to Marie de Médici, marching in crimson robes
at the head of the six guilds of merchants. On the
ceiling was his apotheosis. It showed him sitting,
his lap full of gloves, on a Lyons shawl, which winged
Cherubs were drawing through the air to a naked goddess
on a cloud, who was holding out to him a wreath made
of Dutch tulips. When Madame Troqueville saw it
she shook with laughter, much to Madeleine’s surprise.</p>

<p>Maître Prunier and his family sat on the stage during
the performance, that they might be seen as well as
see. He was a large stout man, and his nose was covered
with warts, but his youngest daughter held Madeleine’s
eyes spellbound. She had lovely golden hair for one
thing, and then, although she looked no older than
Madeleine herself, who was about seven at the time,
she was dressed in a velvet bodice covered with Genoese
point, and—infinitely grander—she was actually wearing
what to Madeline had always seemed one of the attributes
of magnificent eld, to wit, a real stomacher, all
stiff with busks and embroidered in brightly coloured
silks with flowers and enchanting beasts—a thing as
lovely and magical as the armour of Achilles in the
woodcut that hung in the parlour at home.</p>

<p>Some years later Madeleine was sent to school at a
Convent about a mile out of Lyons. One of the scholars
was this very Jeanne Prunier. Madeleine would watch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
her stumbling through the Creed, her fat white face
puckered with effort, her stumpy fingers fiddling
nervously with her gold chain, and would wonder what
great incomprehensible thoughts were passing behind
that greasy forehead and as what strange phantasmagoria
did she see the world. And that chain—it
actually hung round her neck all day long, and when
she went home, was taken through the great wooden
door of Maître Prunier’s house—the door carved with
flowers and grinning faces—and perhaps in a drawer
in her bedroom had a little box of its own. And
Maître Prunier probably knew of its existence, as
doubtless it had been his gift, and thus it had a
place in the consciousness of that great man, while she,
Madeleine ... he had never heard of her.</p>

<p>Lyons, like most rich provincial towns, was very
purse-proud, and this characteristic was already quite
apparent in its young daughters at the Convent. Their
conversation consisted, to a great extent, in boastings
about their fathers’ incomes, and surmises as to those
of the fathers of their companions. They could tell
you the exact number of gold pieces carried on each
girl’s back, and when some one appeared in a new dress
they would come up and finger the material to ascertain
its texture and richness. Every one knew exactly how
many pairs of Spanish gloves, how many yards of
Venetian lace, how many pure silk petticoats were
possessed by every one else, and how many Turkey
carpets and Rouen tapestries and tables of marble
and porphyry, how much gold and silver plate, and
how many beds covered with gold brocade were to be
found in each other’s homes.</p>

<p>As Madeleine’s dresses were made of mere serge, and
contemptible <i>guese</i> was their only trimming, and as
it was known that her father was nothing but a disreputable
attorney, they coldly ignored her, and this made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
her life in the Convent agonising. Although subconsciously
she was registering every ridiculous or vulgar
detail about her passive tormentors, yet her boundless
admiration for them remained quite intact, and to be
accepted as one of their select little coterie, to share
their giggling secrets, to walk arm in arm with one of
them in the Convent garden would be, she felt, the
summit of earthly glory.</p>

<p>One hot summer’s day, it happened that both she
and a member of the Sacred Circle—a girl called Julie
Duval—felt faint in Chapel. A nun had taken them
into the Refectory—the coolest place in the Convent—and
left them to recover. Madeleine never quite knew
how it happened, but she suddenly found herself telling
Julie that her mother was the daughter of a Duke,
and her father the son of an enormously wealthy
merchant of Amsterdam; that he had been sent as
quite a young man on a political mission to the Court
of France, where he had met her mother; that they
had fallen passionately in love with one another, and
had been secretly married; when the marriage was
announced the parents of both were furious, owing to
her father’s family being Protestant, her mother’s
Catholic, and had refused to have anything more to
do with their respective offspring; that her father had
taken the name of Troqueville and settled in Lyons;
that some months ago a letter had come from her
paternal grandfather, in which he told them that he
was growing old and that, although a solemn vow
prevented him from ever looking again on the face
of his son, he would like to see his grandchild before
he died, would she come to Amsterdam?; that she
had refused, saying that she did not care to meet
any one who had treated her father as badly as he;
that the old man had written back to say that he
admired her spirit and had made her his sole heir,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
‘which was really but a cunning device to take, without
tendering his formal forgiveness, the sting from the
act whereby he had disinherited my father, because he
must have been well aware that I would share it all
with him!’ (Unconsciously she had turned her father
into a romantic figure, to whom she was attached with
the pious passion of an Antigone. In reality she gave
all her love to her mother; but the unwritten laws of
rhetoric commanded that the protagonists in this story
should be <i>father</i> and daughter.)</p>

<p>Julie’s eyes grew rounder and rounder at each word.</p>

<p>‘<i>Jésus</i>, Madeleine Troqueville! what a fine lady
you will be!’ she said in an awed voice. Madeleine had
not a doubt that by the next morning she would have
repeated every word of it to her friends.</p>

<p>In the course of the day she half came to believing
the whole story herself, and sailed about with measured,
stately gait; on her lips a haughty, faintly contemptuous
smile. She felt certain that she was the centre of
attention. She was wearing her usual little serge dress
and plain muslin fichu, but if suddenly asked to describe
her toilette, she would have said it was of the richest
velvet foaming with Italian lace. She seemed to herself
four inches taller than she had been the day before,
while her eyes had turned from gray to flashing black,
her hair also was black instead of chestnut.</p>

<p>Mythology was one of the subjects in the Convent
curriculum—a concession to fashion made most unwillingly
by the nuns. But as each story was carefully
expurgated, made as anterotic as possible, and given
a neat little moral, Ovid would scarce have recognised
his own fables. The subject for that day happened to
be Paris’s sojourn as a shepherd on Mount Ida. When
the nun told them he was really the son of the King of
Troy, Madeleine was certain that all the girls were
thinking of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>Several days, however, went by, and no overtures
were made by the Sacred Circle. Madeleine’s stature
was beginning to dwindle, and her hair and eyes to
regain their ordinary colour, when one morning Jeanne
Prunier came up to her, took hold of the little medallion
that hung round her neck on a fine gold chain, and
said: ‘Tiens! c’est joli, ça.’</p>

<p>This exclamation so often interchanged among the
<i>élite</i>, but which Madeleine had never dreamed that any
object belonging to her could elicit, was the prelude to
a period of almost unearthly bliss. She was told the
gallant that each of them was in love with, was given
some of Jeanne’s sweet biscuits and quince jam, and
was made a member of their <i>Dévises</i> Society. The
<i>dévise</i> designed for her was a plant springing out of a
<i>tabouret</i> (the symbol of a Duchess); one of its stems
bore a violet, the other a Dutch tulip, and over them
both hovered the flowery coronet of a Duke—wherein
was shown a disregard for botany but an imaginative
grasp of Madeleine’s circumstances.</p>

<p>At times she felt rather condescending to her new
friends, for the old man could not live much longer,
and when he died she would not only be richer than
any of them, but her mother’s people would probably
invite her to stay with them in Paris, and in time
she might be made a lady-in-waiting to the Regent
... and then, suddenly, the sun would be drowned
and she would feel sick, for a Saint’s day was drawing
near, and they would all go home, and the girls would
tell their parents her story, and their parents would tell
them that it was not true.</p>

<p>The Saint’s day came in due course, and after it,
the awful return to the Convent. Had they been
undeceived about her or had they not? It was difficult
to tell, for during the morning’s work there were few
opportunities for social intercourse. It was true that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
in the embroidery class, when Madeleine absent-mindedly
gave the Virgin a red wool nose instead of a
white one, and the presiding nun scolded her, the girls
looked coldly at her instead of sympathetically; then
in the dancing lesson as a rule the sacred ones gave
her an intimate grin from time to time, or whispered a
pleasantry on the clumsy performance of some companion
outside the Sacred Circle, but this morning they
merely stared at her coldly. Still their indifference
might mean nothing. Did it, or did it not?</p>

<p class="noindent">chanted the little master.</p>

<p>How Madeleine wished she were he, a light, artificial
little creature, with no great claims on life.</p>

<p>But her fears became a certainty, when going into
the closet where they kept their pattens and brushes,
Jeanne commanded her in icy tones to take her ‘dirty
brush’ out of her, Jeanne’s, bag. And that was all. If
they had been boys, uproariously contemptuous, they
would have twitted Madeleine with her lie, but being
girls, they merely sneered and ignored her. She felt
like a spirit that, suspended in mid-air, watches the
body it has left being torn to pieces by a pack of
wolves. Days of dull agony followed, but she felt
strangely resigned, as if she could go on bearing it for
ever and a day.</p>

<p>It was during the Fronde, and Jeanne and her friends
had a cult for Condé and Madame de Longueville, the
royal rebels. They taught their parrots at home to repeat
lines of Mazarinades, they kept a print of Condé at the
battle of Rocroy in their book of Hours, and had pocket
mirrors with his arms emblazoned on the back, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Madame de Longueville simpered at them from miniatures
painted on the top of their powder boxes or the
backs of their tablets. As the nuns, influenced by the
clergy, were strong Royalists, and looked upon Condé
as a sort of Anti-Christ, the girls had to hide their
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Some weeks after Madeleine’s fall, it was announced
that on the following Wednesday there was to be a
public demonstration in favour of Condé and the Frondeurs,
and that there would be fireworks in their
honour, and that some of the streets would be decorated
with paper lanterns.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Jeanne and Julie came to Madeleine
and ordered her to slip out of her window at about
eight o’clock in the evening, go down to the gate at
the end of the avenue, and when they called her from
the other side, to unbolt it for them. They then went
to one of the nuns and, pleading a headache, said they
would like to go to bed, and did not want any
supper.</p>

<p>During the last weeks Madeleine had lost all spirit,
all personality almost, so she followed their instructions
with mechanical submission, and was at the gate
at the appointed time, opened it, let them in, and all
three got back to bed in safety.</p>

<p>About a week later, all the girls were bidden to
assemble in the Refectory, where the Reverend Mother
was awaiting them with a look of Rhadamanthine
severity.</p>

<p>‘Most grievous news had been given her concerning
a matter that must be dealt with without delay. She
would ask all the demoiselles in turn if they had left
their bedrooms on Wednesday evening.’</p>

<p>‘No, Madame.’</p>

<p>‘No, Madame,’ in voices of conscious rectitude, as
one girl after another was asked by name. It was also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
the answer of Jeanne and Julie. Then: ‘Mademoiselle
Troqueville, did you leave your bedroom on Wednesday
evening?’</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then came the answer:
‘Yes, Madame.’</p>

<p>All eyes were turned on her, and Julie, covertly, put
out her tongue.</p>

<p>‘Mesdemoiselles, you may all go, excepting Mademoiselle
Troqueville.’</p>

<p>Madeleine noticed that the Reverend Mother had a
small mole on her cheek, she had not seen it before.</p>

<p>Then came such a scolding as she had never before
experienced. Much mention was made of ‘obedience,’
‘chastity,’ ‘Anti-Christ,’ ‘the enemies of the King and
the Church.’ What had they to do with walking across
the garden and opening a gate? Perhaps she had
shown too much leg in climbing out of the window—that
would, at least, account for the mention of
chastity.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mother had asked <i>if any one had left
their bedroom</i>—that was all—and Madeleine had. And
to her mind, dulled, and, as is often the case, made
stupidly literal by sheer terror, this fact had lost all
connection with Jeanne’s and Julie’s escapade, and
seemed, by itself, the cause of this mysterious tirade.
It certainly was wrong to have left her bedroom—but
why did it make her ‘an enemy of the King’?</p>

<p>She found herself seizing on a word here and there
in the torrent and spelling it backwards.</p>

<p>‘Example’ ... elpmaxe ... rather a pretty word!
<i>la chastité</i> ... étitsahc al ... it sounded like Spanish
... who invented the different languages? Perhaps
a prize had once been offered at a College for the invention
of the best language, and one student invented
French and got the prize, and another nearly got the
second, but it was discovered in time that he had only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
turned his own language backwards, and that was
cheating.... <i>Jésus!</i> there was a little bit of wood
chipped out of the Reverend Mother’s crucifix! But
these thoughts were just a slight trembling on the
surface of fathoms of inarticulate terror and despair.</p>

<p>Then she heard the Reverend Mother telling her that
it would be a sign of grace if she were to disclose the
names of her companions.</p>

<p>In a flash she realised that she was supposed to have
done whatever it was that Jeanne and Julie had done
on Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>‘But, Madame, I didn’t ... ’twas only——’</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle, excuses and denials will avail you
nothing. Who was the other lady with you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it isn’t that ... there were no others, at
least ... ah! I am at a loss how I can best make it
clear, but we are, methinks, at cross-purposes.’</p>

<p>But her case was hopeless. She could not betray
Jeanne and Julie, and even if she had wished to, she
was incapable just then of doing so, feeling too light-headed
and rudderless to make explanations. Finally
she was dismissed, and walked out of the room as if in
a trance.</p>

<p>She was greeted by a clamour of questions and
reproaches from the girls. Jeanne and Julie were in
hysterics. When they discovered that she had not
betrayed them, they muttered some sheepish expressions
of gratitude, and to save their faces they started
badgering her in a half-kindly way for having got
herself into trouble so unnecessarily; why could she
not have said ‘No’ like the rest of them? Madeleine
had no satisfactory answer to give, because she did
not know why herself. In sudden crises it seemed as if
something stepped out from behind her personality and
took matters into its own hands, and spite of all
her good-will it would not allow her to give a false<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
answer to a direct question. And this although, as
we have seen, she could suddenly find herself telling
gratuitous falsehoods by the gross.</p>

<p>Of course Madeleine was in terrible disgrace, and
penance was piled on penance. The Sacred Circle was
friendly to her again, but this brought no comfort
now, and the severe looks of the nuns put her in a perpetual
agony of terror.</p>

<p>About a week went by, and then one day, when she
was sitting in the little room of penance, the door was
thrown open and in rushed Julie turned into a gurgling,
sniffing whirlwind of tears.</p>

<p>‘The Reverend Mother’ ... sob ... ‘says I must’
... sob ... ‘ask your forgiveness’ ... scream, and
then she flopped down on the floor, overcome by the
violence of her emotion. It was clear to Madeleine that
in some miraculous way all had been discovered, but
she did not feel particularly relieved. The ‘movement
of the passions’ seemed to have been arrested in her.
She sat watching Julie with her clear, wide-open eyes,
and her expression was such as one might imagine on
the face of an Eastern god whose function is to gaze
eternally on a spectacle that never for an instant
interests or moves him. She did not even feel scorn for
Julie, just infinite remoteness.</p>

<p>Julie began nervously to shut and open one of her
hands; Madeleine looked at it. It was small and
plump and rather dirty, and on one of its fingers there
was a little enamelled ring, too tight for it, and pressing
into the flesh. It looked like a small distracted animal;
Madeleine remembered a beetle she had once seen struggling
on its back. Its smallness and dirtiness, and the
little tight ring and its suggestion of the beetle, for
some reason touched Madeleine. A sudden wave of
affection and pity for Julie swept over her. In a second
she was down beside her, with her arms around her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
telling her not to cry, and that it didn’t matter. And
there she was found some minutes later by the Reverend
Mother, from whom she received a panegyric of praise
for her forgiving spirit and a kiss, which she could well
have dispensed with.</p>

<p>Then the whole thing was explained; an anonymous
letter had been sent to the Reverend Mother saying
that the writer had seen, on the evening of the demonstration
in favour of Condé, two girls masked and hooded,
evidently of position, as they had attendants with them,
and that they were laughing together about their
escape from the Convent. The Reverend Mother had
never thought of connecting with the affair Jeanne’s and
Julie’s early retirement that evening. Now she had
just got a letter from Maître Prunier informing her
that it had come to his knowledge that his daughter
and her great friend had been walking in the town that
same evening. He had learned this distressing news
from one of his servants whom Jeanne had got to
accompany her on her escapade. He bade the Reverend
Mother keep a stricter watch on his daughter. She had
sent for Jeanne and Julie and they had told her that it
was only through coercion that Madeleine had played
any part in the escapade.</p>

<p>Then the Reverend Mother and Julie went away, and
Jeanne came in to offer her apologies. She also had
evidently been crying, and her mouth had a sulky
droop which did not suggest that her self-complacency
had shrivelled up, like that of Julie.
Madeleine found herself resenting this; how <i>dare</i> she
not be abject?</p>

<p>The two following sentences contained Jeanne’s
apology:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) ‘The Reverend Mother is a spiteful old dragon!’
and she sniffed angrily.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) ‘Will you come home for my Fête Day next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
month? There is to be a Collation and a Ball and a
Comedy,’ and she gave the little wriggle of her hips,
and the complacent gesture of adjusting her collar,
which were so characteristic.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, this invitation would have sent
Madeleine into an ecstasy of pleasure. To enter that
great fantastic door had seemed a thing one only did
in dreams. As Jeanne gave her invitation she saw it
clearly before her, cut off from the house and the street
and the trees, just itself, a finely embossed shield against
the sky. It was like one of the woodcuts that she had
seen in a booth of the Fair that year by a semi-barbarian
called Master Albert Dürer. Woodcuts of one carrot,
or a king-fisher among the reeds, or, again, a portion
of the grassy bank of a high road, shown as a busy little
commonwealth of bees and grasses, and frail, sturdy
flowers, heedless of and unheeded by the restless stream
of the high road, stationary and perfect like some obscure
island of the Ægean. The world seen with the eyes
of an elf or an insect ... how strange! Then she
looked at Jeanne, and suddenly there flashed before
her a sequence of little ignoble things she had subconsciously
registered against her. She had a provincial
accent and pronounced <i>volontiers</i>, <i>voulentiers</i>; she
had a nasty habit of picking her nose; Madeleine had
often witnessed her being snubbed by one of the nuns,
and then blushing; there was something indecently
bourgeois in the way she turned the pages of a
book.</p>

<p>The ignoble pageant took about two seconds for its
transit, then Madeleine said, ‘I am much beholden to
you, albeit, I fear me I cannot assist at your Fête,’
and dropping her a curtsey she opened the door, making
it quite clear that Jeanne was to go, which she did,
without a word, as meek as a lamb.</p>

<p>In Madeleine’s description of this scene to Jacques<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
long afterwards she made herself say to Jeanne what
actually she had only thought; many young people,
often the most sensitive, hanker after the power of
being crudely insolent: it seems to them witty
and mature.</p>

<p>That night Madeleine was delirious, and Madame
Troqueville was sent for. It was the beginning of a
long illness which, for want of a better name, her doctor
called a sharp attack of the spleen.</p>

</div>

<p>In time she recovered, or at least was supposed to
have recovered, but she did not return to the Convent,
and her mother still watched her anxiously and was
more than ever inclined to give in to her in everything.</p>

<p>The doctor had advised her to continue taking an
infusion of steel in white wine, and to persist in daily
exercise, the more violent the better. So at first she
would spend several hours of the day playing at shuttlecock
with her mother, but Madame Troqueville’s energy
failing her after the first few weeks, Madeleine was
forced to pursue her cure by herself.</p>

<p>She found the exercise led to vague dreaming of a
semi-dramatic nature—imaginary arguments with a
nameless opponent dimly outlined against a background
of cloth of gold—arguments in which she herself
was invariably victorious. In time, she discarded the
shuttlecock completely, finding that this semi-mesmeric
condition was reached more easily through a wild dance,
rhythmic but formless.</p>

<p>In the meantime her social values had become more
just, and she realised that rank is higher than wealth,
and that she herself, as the granddaughter of a Judge
of the Paris <i>Parlement</i>, and even as the daughter of
a <i>procureur</i>, was of more importance socially than the
daughters of merchants, however wealthy.</p>

<p>Round the Intendant of the province and his wife
there moved a select circle, dressed in the penultimate
Paris fashion, using the penultimate Paris slang, and
playing for very high stakes at Hoc and Reversi. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
was to this circle that Madeleine’s eyes now turned
with longing, as they had formerly done to the Sacred
Circle at the Convent.</p>

<p>In time she got to know some of these Olympians.
Those with whom she had the greatest success were the
Précieuses, shrill, didactic ladies who by their unsuccessful
imitation of their Paris models made Lyons the
laughing-stock of the metropolis. Some of them would
faint at the mention of a man’s name; indeed, one of
them, who was also a <i>dévote</i>, finding it impossible to reconcile
her prudishness with the idea of a male Redeemer,
started a theory that Christ had been really a woman—‘’Tis
clear from His clothes,’ she would say—and
that the beard that painters gave Him, was only part
of a plot to wrest all credit from women. They spoke
a queer jargon, full of odd names for the most ordinary
objects and barely intelligible to the uninitiated.
Madeleine talked as much like them as self-consciousness
would permit. Also, she copied them in a
scrupulous care of her personal appearance, and in
their attention to personal cleanliness, which was
considered by the world at large as ridiculous as
their language. Madame Troqueville feared she
would ruin her by the expensive scents—<i>poudre
d’iris</i>, <i>musc</i>, <i>civette</i>, <i>eau d’ange</i>—with which she
drenched herself.</p>

<p>In the meantime she had got to know a grubby,
smirking old gentleman who kept a book-shop and
fancied himself as a literary critic. He used to procure
the most recent publications of Sercy and Quinet and the
other leading Paris publishers, and his shop became a
favourite resort of a throng of poetasters and young
men of would-be fashion who came there to read and
criticise in the manner of the Paris <i>muguets</i>. Hither
also came Madeleine, and in a little room behind the
shop, where she was safe from ogles and insolence, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
would devour all the books that pleased and modelled
the taste of the day.</p>

<p>Here were countless many-volumed romances, such
as the <i>Astrée</i> of Honoré d’Urfé, La Calprenèdes’s
<i>Cassandre</i>, and that flower of modernity, Mademoiselle
de Scudéry’s <i>Grand Cyrus</i>. <i>Romans à clef</i>, they were
called, for in them all the leaders of fashion, all the
<i>bels esprits</i> of the day were dressed up in classical or
Oriental costumes, and set to the task of fitting the
fashions and fads of modern Paris into the conditions
of the ancient world or of the kingdom of the Grand
Turk. But the important thing in these romances was
what Madeleine called to herself, with some complacency
at the name, ‘<i>l’escrime galante</i>’—conversations
in which the gallant, with an indefatigable nimbleness
of wit, pays compliment after compliment to the
prudishly arch belle, by whom they are parried with
an equal nimbleness and perseverance. If the gallant
manages to get out a declaration, then the belle is
<i>touchée</i>, and in her own eyes disgraced for ever. Then,
often, paragons of <i>esprit</i> and <i>galanterie</i>, and the
other urbane qualities necessary to <i>les honnêtes gens</i>,
give long-winded discourses on some subtle point in
the psychology of lovers. And all this against a background
of earthquakes and fires and hair-breadth
escapes, which, together with the incredible coldness
of the capricious heroine, go to prove that nothing
can wither the lilies and roses of the hero’s love and
patience and courage. Then there were countless books
of <i>Vers Galants</i>, sonnets, and madrigals by beplumed,
beribboned poets, who, like pedlars of the Muses, displayed
their wares in the <i>ruelles</i> and alcoves of great
ladies. There were collections of letters, too, or rather,
of <i>jeux d’esprit</i>, in which verse alternated with prose
to twist carefully selected news into something which
had the solidity of a sonnet, the grace of a madrigal.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Of these letters, Madeleine was most dazzled by those
of the late Vincent Voiture, Jester, and spoilt child
of the famous Hôtel de Rambouillet, and through
his letters she came to feel that she almost knew personally
all those laughing, brilliant people, who had
made the Hôtel so famous in the reign of Louis XIII.—the
beautiful touchy ‘Lionne,’ with her lovely voice
and burnished hair; the Princess Julie, suave and
mocking, and, like all her family, an incorrigible tease;
and the great Arthénice herself, whimsical and golden-hearted,
with a humorous, half-apologetic chastity.
She knew them all, and the light fantastic world in
which they lived, a world of mediæval romance <i>pour
rire</i>, in which magic palaces sprang up in the night,
and where ordinary mortals who had been bold enough
to enter were apt to be teased as relentlessly as Falstaff
by the fairies of Windsor Forest.</p>

<p>But what Madeleine pored over most of all was the
theory of all these elegant practices, embodied in species
of guide-books to the polite world, filled with elaborate
rules as to the right way of entering a room and of
leaving it, analyses of the grades of deference or of
insolence that could be expressed by a curtsey, the words
which must be used and the words that must not be
used, and all the other tiny things which, pieced together,
would make the paradigm of an <i>honnête homme</i> or a
<i>femme galante</i>. There Madeleine learned that the
most heinous crime after that of being a bourgeois,
was to belong to the Provinces, and the glory speedily
departed from the Lyons Précieuses to descend on those
of Paris. Her own surroundings seemed unbearable,
and when she was not storming at the Virgin for having
made her an obscure provincial, she was pestering
her with prayers to transplant her miraculously to some
higher sphere.</p>

<p>The craze for Jansenism—that Catholic Calvinism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
deduced from the writings of Saint Augustine by the
Dutch Jansen, and made fashionable by the accomplished
hermits of Port-Royal—already just perceptibly on the
wane in Paris, had only recently reached Lyons. As
those of Paris some years before, the haberdashers
of Lyons now filled their shops with collars and garters
<i>à la Janséniste</i>, and the booksellers with the charming
treatises on theology by ‘<i>les Messieurs de Port-Royal</i>.’
Many of the ladies became enamoured of the ‘furiously
delicious Saint Augustine,’ and would have little debates,
one side sustaining the view that his hair had been
dark, the other that it had been fair. They raved about
his Confessions, vowing that there was in it a ‘Je ne
sais quoi de doux et de passionné.’</p>

<p>Madeleine also caught the craze and in as superficial a
manner as the others. For instance, the three petticoats
worn by ladies which the Précieuses called ‘<i>la modeste</i>,’
‘<i>la friponne</i>,’ and ‘<i>la secrète</i>,’ she rechristened ‘<i>la grâce
excitante</i>,’ ‘<i>la grâce subséquente</i>,’ and ‘<i>la grâce efficace</i>.’
She gained from this quite a reputation in Lyons.</p>

<p>That Lent, the wife of the Intendant manœuvred
that a priest of recognised Jansenist leanings should
preach a sermon in the most fashionable Church of the
town. He based his sermon on the Epistle for the
day, which happened to be 2 Timothy, iii. 1.
‘This know also, that in the last days perilous times
shall come. <i>For men shall be lovers of their own selves.</i>’
The whole sermon was a passionate denunciation
of <i>amour-propre</i>—<i>self-love</i> according to its earliest
meaning—that newly-discovered sin that was to
dominate the psychology of the seventeenth century.
By a certain imaginative quality in his florid rhetoric,
he made his hearers feel it as a thing loathly, poisonous,
parasitic. After a description of the awful loneliness of
the self-lover, cut off for ever from God and man, he
thundered out the following peroration:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>‘Listen! This Narcissus gazing into the well of his
own heart beholds, not that reflection which awaits
the eyes of every true Christian, a Face with eyes like
unto swords and hair as white as wool, a King’s head
crowned with thorns, no, what meets <i>his</i> eyes is his
own sinful face. In truth, my brethren, a grievous
and unseemly vision, but anon his face will cast a
shadow a thousand-fold more unsightly and affrighting—to
wit, the fiery eyes and foaming jowl of the
Dragon himself. For to turn into a flower is but a pretty
fancy of the heathen, to turn into the Dragon is the
doom of the Christian Narcissus.’</p>

<p>Madeleine left the Church deeply moved. She had
realised that <i>she</i> was such a Narcissus and that ‘<i>amour-propre</i>’
filled every cranny of her heart.</p>

<p>She turned once more to the publications of Port-Royal,
this time not merely in quest of new names for
petticoats, and was soon a convinced Jansenist.</p>

<p>Jansenism makes a ready appeal to egotists ... is
it not founded on the teaching of those two arch-egotists,
Saint Paul and Saint Augustine? And so Madeleine
found in Jansenism a spiritual pabulum much to her
liking. For instance, grace comes to the Jansenist in
a passion of penitence, an emotion more natural to
an egotist than the falling in love with Christ which
was the seal of conversion in the time of Louis XIII.,
with its mystical Catholicism <i>à l’espagnole</i>, touched
with that rather charming <i>fadeur</i> peculiar to France.
Then to the elect (among whom Madeleine never
doubted she was numbered) there is something very
flattering in the paradox of the Jansenists that although
it is from the Redemption only that Grace flows, and
Christ died for all men, yet Grace is no vulgar blessing
in which all may participate, but it is reserved for those
whom God has decided shall, through no merit of their
own, eventually be saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>Above all, Jansenism seemed made for Madeleine
in that it promised a remedy for man’s ‘sick will,’ a
remedy which perhaps would be more efficacious than
steel and white wine for the lassitude, the moral leakage,
the truly ‘sick will’ from which she had suffered so long.
The Jansenist remedy was a complete abandonment to
God, ‘an oarless drifting on the full sea of Grace,’ and
at first this brought to her a sense of very great peace.</p>

<p>Her favourite of the Port-Royal books was <i>La
Fréquente Communion</i>, in which the Père Arnauld
brought to bear on Theology in full force his great
inheritance, the Arnauld legal mind, crushing to
powder the treatise of a certain Jesuit priest who
maintained that a Christian can benefit from the
Eucharist without Penitence.</p>

<p>Influenced by this book, very few Jansenists felt
that they had reached the state of grace necessary for
making a good Communion.</p>

<p>So, what with self-examination, self-congratulation,
and abstaining from the Eucharist, for a time Jansenism
kept Madeleine as happy and occupied as a new diet
keeps a <i>malade imaginaire</i>. Her emotions when she
danced became more articulate. She saw herself the
new abbess of Port-Royal, the wise, tender adviser of
the ‘Solitaires,’ Mère Angélique with a beautiful humility
having abdicated in her favour, ‘for here is one greater
than I.’ She went through her farewell address to her
nuns, an address of infinite beauty and pathos. She
saw herself laid out still and cold in the Chapel, covered
with flowers culled by royal fingers in the gardens of
Fontainebleau, with the heart-broken nuns sobbing
around her. Finally the real Madeleine flung herself
on her bed, the tears streaming from her eyes. Her
subtle enemy, <i>amour-propre</i>, had taken the veil.</p>

<p>She had started a diary of her spiritual life, in which
she recorded the illuminations, the temptations, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
failures, the reflections, the triumphs, of each day.
The idea suddenly occurred to her of sending the whole
to Mère Agnès Arnauld, who was head of the Paris
Port-Royal. She wrote her also a letter in which she
told her of certain difficulties that had troubled her in
the Jansenist doctrine, suggested by the Five Propositions.
These were conclusions of an heretical nature,
drawn from Jansen’s book and submitted to the Pope.
The Jansenists denied that they were fair conclusions,
but in their attempt to prove this, they certainly laid
themselves open to the charge of obscurantism. She
included in her letter the following <i>énigme</i> she had
written on <i>amour-propre</i>, on the model of those of
the Abbé Cotin, whose fertile imagination was only
equalled by his fine disregard of the laws of prosody.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The pun on ‘Grace’ seemed to her a stroke of genius.
She was certain that Mère Agnès could not fail to be
deeply impressed with the whole communication, and
to realise that Madeleine was an instrument exquisitely
tempered by God for fine, delicate work in His service.
Madeleine planned beforehand the exact words of Mère
Agnèse’s answer:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Your words have illumined like a lamp for myself
and my sister many a place hitherto dark.’ ‘My dearest
child, God has a great work for you.’ ‘My brother says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
that the Holy Spirit has so illumined for you the pages
of his book, that you have learned from it things he did
not know were there himself,’</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">were a few of the sentences. In the actual letter, however,
none of them occurred. Mère Agnès seemed to
consider Madeleine’s experiences very usual, and
irritated her extremely by saying with regard to some
difficulty that Madeleine had thought unutterably
subtle and original:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Now I will say to you what I always say to my nuns
when they are perplexed by that difficulty.’</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The letter ended with these words of exhortation:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Remember that pride of intellect is the most deadly
and difficult to combat of the three forms of Concupiscence,
and that the pen, although it can be touched into a shining
weapon of God’s, is a favourite tool of the Evil One, for
<i>amour-propre</i> is but too apt to seize it from behind and
make it write nothing but one’s own praises, and that
when one would fain be writing the praises of God.
Are you certain, my dear child, that this has not
happened to you? Conceits and <i>jeux d’esprit</i> may sometimes
without doubt be used to the Glory of God, as, for
example, in the writings of the late Bishop of Geneva of
thrice blessed memory. But by him they were always
used as were the Parables of Our Lord, to make hard
truths clear to simple minds, but you, my child, are not
yet a teacher. Examine your heart as to whether there
was not a little vanity in your confessions. I will urgently
pray that grace may be sent you, to help you to a <i>true</i>
examination of your own heart.’</p>

</div>

<p>In Madeleine’s heart rage gave way to a dull sense
of failure. She would not be a Jansenist at all if she
could not be an eminent one. It was quite clear to her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
that her conversion had merely reinforced her <i>amour-propre</i>.
What was to be done?</p>

<p>Jansenism had by no means destroyed her hankerings
after the polite society of Paris, it had merely pushed
them on to a lower shelf in her consciousness. One night
she dreamed that she was walking in a garden in thrillingly
close communion with the Duc de Candale.
Their talk was mainly about his green garters, but in
her dream it had been fraught with passionate meaning.
Suddenly he turned into Julie de Rambouillet, but the
emotion of the intimacy was just as poignant. This
dream haunted her all the following day. Then in a
flash it occurred to her that it had been sent from above
as a direct answer to prayer. Obviously love for some
one else was the antidote to <i>amour-propre</i>. This was
immediately followed by another inspiration. Ordinary
love was gradually becoming a crime in the code of the
Précieuses, and ‘<i>l’amitié tendre</i>’ the perfect virtue.
But would it not be infinitely more ‘gallant’ and distinguished
to make a <i>woman</i> the object of that friendship?
It seemed to her the obvious way of keeping
friendship stationary, an elegant statue in the discreet
and shady groves of Plato’s Academe which lies in such
dangerous contiguity to the garden of Epicurus. Thus
did she settle the demands at once of Jansenism and of
the Précieuses.</p>

<p>The problem that lay before her now was to find an
object for this Platonic tenderness. Julie de Rambouillet,
as a wife, mother, and passionately attached
daughter, could scarcely have a wide enough emotional
margin to fit her for the rôle. After first choosing and
then discarding various other ladies, she settled on
Madeleine de Scudéry. Unmarried and beyond the age
when one is likely to marry (she was over forty), evidently
of a romantic temperament, very famous, she had every
qualification that Madeleine could wish. Then there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
was the coincidence of the name, a subject for pleasant
thrills. Madeleine soon worked up through her dances
a blazing pseudo <i>flamme</i>. The sixth book of Cyrus,
which treats of Mademoiselle de Scudéry herself, under
the name of Sappho, and of her own circle, seemed full
of tender messages for <i>her</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Moreover, she is faithful in her friendships; and she
has a soul so tender, and a heart so passionate, that one
may certainly place the supreme felicity in being loved
by Sappho.’</p>

<p>‘I conceive that beyond a doubt there is nothing so
sweet as to be loved by a person that one loves.’</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">She pictured herself filling the rôle of Phaon, whom
she had heard was but an imaginary character,
Mademoiselle de Scudéry having as yet made no one
a ‘<i>Citoyen de Tendre</i>.’</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘And the most admirable thing about it was that in
the midst of such a large company, Sappho did not fail
to find a way of giving Phaon a thousand marks of affection,
and even of sacrificing all his rivals to him, without
their remarking it.’</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Oh, the thrill of it! It would set Madeleine dancing
for hours.</p>

<p>The emotions of her dances were at first but a vague
foretasting of future triumphs and pleasures, shot
with pictures of wavering outlines and conversations
semi-articulate. But she came in time to feel a need for
a scrupulous exactitude in details, as if her pictures
acquired some strange value by the degree of their
accuracy. What that value was, she could not have
defined, but her imaginings seemed now to be moulding
the future in some way, to be making events that would
actually occur.... It was therefore necessary that
they should be well within the bounds of probability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>This new conviction engendered a sort of loyalty to
Mademoiselle de Scudéry, for previously a stray word
or suggestion would fire her with the charms of some
other lady, whom she would proceed to make for the
time the centre of her rites—la Comtesse de la Suze,
after having read her poetry, the Marquise de Sévigné,
when she had heard her praised as a witty beauty—but
now, with the fortitude of a Saint Anthony, she would
chase the temptresses from her mind, and firmly nail
her longings to Mademoiselle de Scudéry. And soon the
temptation to waver left her, and Mademoiselle de
Scudéry became a corroding obsession. She began to
crave feverishly to go to Paris. Lyons turned into a
city of Hell, where everything was a ghastly travesty
of Heaven. The mock Précieuses with their grotesque
graces, the vulgar dandies, so complacently unconscious
of their provincialism, the meagre parade of the Promenade,
it was all, she was certain, like the uncouth
Paris of a nightmare. If she went to Paris, she would,
of course, immediately meet Mademoiselle de Scudéry,
who, on the spot, would be fatally wounded by her
<i>esprit</i> and air gallant, and the following days would
lead the two down a gentle slope straight to <i>le Pays
de Tendre</i>. But how was she to get to Paris?</p>

<p>Then, as if by a miracle, her father was also seized
by a longing to go to Paris, and finally a complete <i>déménagement</i>
was decided upon. What wonder if Madeleine
felt that the gods were upon her side?</p>

<p>But once in Paris, she was brought face to face with
reality. It had never struck her that a meeting with
Mademoiselle de Scudéry might be a thing to need
manœuvring. Days, weeks, went by, and she had not
yet met her. She began to realise the horror of time,
as opposed to eternity. Her meeting with Mademoiselle
de Scudéry could only be the result of a previous chain
of events, not an isolated miracle. To fit it into an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
air-tight compartment of causality and time, seemed to
require more volition than her ‘sick will’ could compass.</p>

<p>Then there was the maddening thought that while
millions of people were dead, and millions not yet born,
and millions living at the other side of the world,
Mademoiselle de Scudéry was at that very moment
alive, and actually living in the same town as herself,
and yet she could not see her, could not speak to her.
What difference was there in her life at Paris to that
at Lyons?</p>

<p>They had settled, as we have seen, in the Quartier
de l’Université, as it was cheap, and not far from the
Île Notre-Dame, where Jacques and Monsieur Troqueville
went every day, to the Palais de Justice. It was a
quarter rich in the intellectual beauty of tradition and
in the tangible beauty of lovely objects, but—it was not
fashionable and therefore held no charm for Madeleine.</p>

<p>The things she valued were to be found in the
quarters of Le Marais, of the Arsenal, of the Faubourg
Saint-Honoré, of the Place Royale. She hated the
Rambouillets for not begging her to live with them,
she hated the people in the streets for not acclaiming
her with shouts of welcome every time she appeared,
she hated Mademoiselle de Scudéry for never having
heard of her. Whenever she passed a tall, dark lady, she
would suddenly become very self-conscious, and raising
her voice, would try and say something striking in the
hopes that it might be she.</p>

<p>She was woken every morning by the cries of the
hawkers:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Grobets, craquelines; brides à veau, pour friands
museaux!’</p>

<p>‘Qui en veut?’</p>

<p>‘Salade, belle Salade!’</p>

<p>‘La douce cerise, la griotte à confire, cerises de Poitiers!’</p>

<p>‘Amandes nouvelles, amandes douces; amendez-vous!’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>And above these cries from time to time would rise
the wail of an old woman carrying a basket laden with
spoons and buttons and old rags,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Vous désirez quelque cho-o-se?’</p>

</div>

<p>Was it Fate come to mock her?</p>

<p>There is no position so difficult to hold for any length
of time as a logical one. Even before leaving Lyons, in
Madeleine’s mind the steps had become obliterated of
that ruthless argument by which the Augustinian doctors
lead the catechumen from the premises set down by
Saint Paul to conclusions in which there is little room
for hope. She struggled no longer in close mental
contact—according to Jansenius’s summing up of the
contents of Christianity—with:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Hope or Concupiscence, or any of the forms of Grace;
or with the price or the punishment of man, or with his
beatitude or his misery; or with free-will and its enslavage;
or with predestination and its effect; or with the love and
justice and mercy and awfulness of God; in fact, with
neither the Old nor the New Testament.’</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">But, without any conscious ‘revaluing of values,’ the
kindly god of the Semi-Pelagians, a God so humble as
to be grateful for the tiniest crumb of virtue offered
Him by His superb and free creatures, this God was
born in her soul from the mists made by expediency,
habit, and the ‘Passions.’</p>

<p>But when she had come to Paris and no miracle had
happened, she began to get desperate, and Semi-Pelagianism
cannot live side by side with despair. The
kind Heavenly Father had vanished, and His place
was taken by a purblind and indifferent deity who
needed continual propitiation.</p>

<p>These changes in her religious attitude took place,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
as I have said, unconsciously, and Madeleine considered
herself still a sound Jansenist.</p>

<p>As a consequence of this spiritual slackening, the
imaginary connection had been severed between her
obsession and her religion. She had forgotten that her
love for Mademoiselle de Scudéry had originally been
conceived as a remedy for <i>amour-propre</i>. But, about
a week before the dinner at Madame Pilou’s, she had
come upon these lines of Voiture:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘De louange, et d’honneur, vainement affamée,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vous ne pouvez aimer, et voulez estre aymée.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To her fevered imagination these innocent words
hinted at some mysterious law which had ordained that
the spurner of love should in his turn be spurned. She
remembered that it was a commonplace in the writings
of both the ancients and the moderns that it was an
ironical lawgiver who had compiled the laws of destiny.
And if this particular law were valid, the self-lover was
on the horns of a horrible dilemma, for, while he continued
in a condition of <i>amour-propre</i>, he was shut off
from the love of God, but if he showed his repentance
by falling in love, he was bringing on himself the
appointed penalty of loving in vain. And here her
morbid logic collapsed, and she thought of a very
characteristic means of extricating herself. She would
immediately start a love affair that it might act as a
buffer between the workings of this law and her future
affair with Mademoiselle de Scudéry.</p>

<p>It was this plan that had sent her to Jacques with
the startling announcement I have already mentioned,
that she loved him very much, and that he might take
his fill of kissing her.</p>

<p>A few days after the dinner at Madame Pilou’s
Madeleine was dancing Mænad-like up and down her
little room. Then with eyes full of a wild triumph she
flung herself on her bed.</p>

<p>Beside her on the table lay the sixth volume of <i>Le
Grand Cyrus</i>, which she had taken to using as a kind of
<i>Sortes Virgilianæ</i>. She picked it up and opened it.
Her eyes fell on the following words:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘For with regard to these ladies, who take pleasure in
being loved without loving; the only satisfaction which
lies in store for them, is that which vanity can give them.’</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">She shut it impatiently and opened it again. This
time, it was these words that stood out:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Indeed,’ added she, ‘I remember that my dislike came
near to hatred for a passably pleasant gentlewoman——’</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Madeleine crossed herself nervously, got down from her
bed, and took several paces up and down the room, and
then opened the book again.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Each moment his jealousy and perturbation waxed
stronger.’</p>

</div>

<p>Three attempts, and not one word of good omen.
She had the sense of running round and round in an
endless circle between the four walls of a tiny, dark
cell. Through the bars she could see one or two stars,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
and knew that out there lay the wide, cool, wind-blown
world of causality, governed by eternal laws that nothing
could alter. But knowing this did not liberate her
from her cell, round which she continued her aimless
running till the process made her feel sick and dizzy.</p>

<p>She opened the book again. This time her eyes fell
on words that, in relation to her case, had no sense.
She looked restlessly round the room for some other
means of divination. The first thing she noticed was
her comb. She seized it and began counting the teeth,
repeating:—</p>

<p>‘Elle m’aime un peu, beaucoup, passionément, pas
de tout.’ ‘Passionément’ came on the last tooth.
She gave a great sigh of relief; it was as if something
relaxed within her.</p>

<p>Then the door opened, and Berthe padded in, smiling
mysteriously.</p>

<p>‘A lackey has brought Mademoiselle this letter.’
Madeleine seized it. It had not been put in an envelope,
but just folded and sealed. It was addressed in a very
strange hand, large and illegible, to:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mademoiselle Troqueville,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Petite Rue du Paon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Above the baker Paul,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">At the Sign of the Cock,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Near the Collège de Bourgogne.</span></p>

</div>

<p>‘He wore a brave livery,’ Berthe went on, ‘the cloth
must have cost several <i>écus</i> the yard, and good strong
shoes, but no pattens. I wouldn’t let him in to stink
the house, I told him——’</p>

<p>‘Would you oblige me by leaving me alone, Berthe?’
said Madeleine. Berthe chuckled and withdrew.</p>

<p>A letter brought to her by a lackey, and in a strange
writing! Her heart stood still. It must either be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
from Mademoiselle de Scudéry or Madame de Rambouillet,
it did not much matter which. She felt deadly
sick. Everything danced before her. She longed to get
into the air and run for miles—away from everything.
She rushed back into her room, and locked the door.
She still was unable to open the letter. Then she
pulled herself together and broke the seal. Convinced
that it was from Mademoiselle de Scudéry, she threw
it down without reading it, and, giggling sheepishly,
gave several leaps up and down the room. Then she
clenched her hands, drew a deep breath, picked it up
and opened it again. Though the lines danced before
her like the reflection of leaves in a stream, she was
able to decipher the signature. It was: ‘Votre obéissante
à vous faire service, M. Cornuel.’ Strange to say,
it was with a feeling of relief that Madeleine realised
that it was not from Mademoiselle de Scudéry. She
then read the letter through.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Mademoiselle</span>,—My worthy friend, Madame Pilou,
has made mention of you to me. Mademoiselle de Scudéry
and I intend to wait on Madame de Rambouillet at two
o’clock, Thursday of next week. An you would call at a
quarter to two at my Hôtel, the Marais, rue St-Antoine,
three doors off from the big butcher’s, opposite <i>Les
Filles d’Elizabeth</i>, I shall be glad to drive you to the
Hôtel de Rambouillet and present you to the Marquise.’</p>

</div>

<p>The Lord was indeed on her side! So easily had He
brushed aside the hundreds of chances that would have
prevented her first meeting Mademoiselle de Scudéry
at the Hôtel de Rambouillet, on which, as we have
seen, she had set her heart.</p>

<p>In a flash God became once more glorious and moral—a
Being that cares for the work of His hands, a maker
and keeper of inscrutable but entirely beneficent laws,
not merely a Daimon of superstitious worship. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
she looked at her letter again. So Madame Cornuel had
not bothered to tie it round with a silk ribbon and put
it in an envelope! She was seized by a helpless
paroxysm of rage.</p>

<p>‘In my answer I’ll call her <i>Dame</i> Cornuel,’ she
muttered furiously. Then she caught sight of the
Crucifix above her bed, and she was suddenly filled
with terror. Was this the way to receive the great
kindness of Christ in having got her the invitation?
Really, it was enough to make Him spoil the whole
thing in disgust. She crossed herself nervously and
threw herself on her knees. At first there welled up
from her heart a voiceless song of praise and love ...
but this was only for a moment, then her soul dropped
from its heights into the following Litany:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">‘Blessed Virgin, Mother of Our Lord, make me shine
on Thursday.</p>

<p class="hanging">Guardian Angel, that watchest over me, make me shine
on Thursday.</p>

<p class="hanging">Blessed Saint Magdalene, make me shine on Thursday.</p>

<p class="hanging">Blessed Virgin, Mother of Our Lord, give me the friendship
of Mademoiselle de Scudéry.</p>

<p class="hanging">Guardian Angel, that watchest over me, give me the
friendship of Mademoiselle de Scudéry.</p>

<p class="hanging">Blessed Saint Magdalene, give me the friendship of
Mademoiselle de Scudéry.’</p>

</div>

<p>She gabbled this over about twenty times. Then she
started a wild dance of triumphant anticipation. It
was without plot, as in the old days; just a wallowing
in an indefinitely glorious future. She was interrupted
by her mother’s voice calling her. Feeling guilty and
conciliatory, as she always did when arrested in her
revels, she called back:—</p>

<p>‘I am coming, Mother,’ and went into the parlour.
Madame Troqueville was mending a jabot of Madeleine’s.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Monsieur Troqueville was sitting up primly on a chair,
and Jacques was sprawling over a chest.</p>

<p>‘My love, Berthe said a lackey brought a letter for
you. We have been impatient to learn whom it was
from.’</p>

<p>‘It was from Madame Cornuel, asking me to go with
her on Thursday to the Hôtel de Rambouillet....
Mademoiselle de Scudéry is to be there too.’</p>

<p>(Madeleine would much rather have not mentioned
Mademoiselle de Scudéry at all, but she felt somehow
or other that it would be ‘bearing testimony’ and that
she <i>must</i>.)</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville went pink with pleasure, and
Jacques’s eyes shone.</p>

<p>‘Madame de Rambouillet! The sister of Tallemant
des Réaux, I suppose. Her husband makes a lot of
cuckolds. Madame <i>Cornuel</i>, did you say? If she’s
going to meet young Rambouillet, it will be her husband
that will have the <i>cornes</i>! <i>hein</i>, Jacques? <i>hein?</i> It
will be he that has the <i>cornes</i>, won’t it?’ exclaimed
Monsieur Troqueville, who was peculiarly impervious
to emotional atmosphere, chuckling delightedly, and
winking at Jacques, his primness having suddenly
fallen from him. Madeleine gave a little shrug and
turned to the door, but Madame Troqueville, turning
to her husband, said icily:—</p>

<p>‘’Twas of the <i>Marquise</i> de Rambouillet that Madeleine
spoke, no kin whatever of the family you mention.
Pray, my love, tell us all about it. Which Madame
Cornuel is it?’</p>

<p>Monsieur Troqueville went on giggling to himself,
absolutely intoxicated by his own joke, and Madeleine
began eagerly:—</p>

<p>‘Oh! the famous one ... “Zénocrite” in the <i>Grand
Cyrus</i>. She’s an exceeding rich widow and a good friend
of Mademoiselle de Scudéry. She is famed in the Court<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
and in the Town, for her quaint and pungent wit.
’Twas she who stuck on the malcontents the name of
“<i>les Importants</i>,” you know, she——’</p>

<p>‘I had some degree of intimacy with her in the past,’
said Madame Troqueville, then in a would-be careless
voice, ‘I wonder if she has any sons!’ Madeleine shut
her eyes and groaned, and Jacques with his eyes dancing
dragged up Monsieur Troqueville, and they left the
house.</p>

<p>So her mother had known Madame Cornuel once;
Madeleine looked round the little room. There was a
large almanac, adorned, as was the custom, with a
woodcut representing the most important event in
the previous year. This one was of Mazarin as a Roman
General with Condé and Retz as barbarian prisoners
tied to his chariot; her mother had bound its edges
with saffron ribbon. The chairs had been covered by
her with bits of silk and brocade from the chest in
which every woman of her day cherished her sacred
hoard. On the walls were samplers worked by her
when she had been a girl.</p>

<p>What was her life but a pitiful attempt to make the
best of things? And Madeleine had been planning to
leave her behind in this pathetically thin existence,
while she herself was translated to unutterable glory.
It suddenly struck her that her <i>amour-propre</i> had
sinned more against her mother than any one else. She
threw her arms round her neck and hugged her convulsively,
then ran back to her own room, her eyes full
of tears. She flung herself on her knees.</p>

<p>‘Blessed Virgin, help me to show that I am sensible
to your great care over me by being more loving and
dutiful to my mother, and giving her greater assistance
in the work of the house. Oh, and please let pleasant
things be in store for <i>her also</i>. And oh! Blessed Lady,
let me cut an exceeding brave figure on Thursday.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Give me occasions for airing all the conceits I prepare
beforehand. Make me look furiously beautiful and
noble, and let them all think me <i>dans le dernier galant</i>,
but mostly <i>her</i>. <i>Give me the friendship of Mademoiselle
de Scudéry.</i>’ She had not meant to add this long
petition about herself, but the temptation had been
too great.</p>

<p>And now to business. She must ensure success by
being diligent in her dancing, thus helping God to get
her her heart’s desire.</p>

<p>Semi-Pelagianism does not demand the blind faith
of the Jansenists. Also, it implicitly robs the Almighty
of omnipotence. Thus was Madeleine a true Semi-Pelagian
in endeavouring to assist God to effect her
Salvation (we know she considered her Salvation
inextricably bound up with the attainment of the friendship
of Mademoiselle de Scudéry), for:—</p>

<p>‘The differentia of semi-Pelagianism is the tenet
that in regeneration, and all that results from it, the
divine and the human will are co-operating, co-efficient
(synergistic) factors.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the train of the shadowy figure of Madame Cornuel,
Madeleine mounts the great stairs of the Hôtel de
Rambouillet. The door is flung open; they enter the
famous <i>Salle Bleue</i>. Lying on a couch is an elderly lady
with other ladies sitting round her, at whose feet sit
gallants on their outspread cloaks.</p>

<p>‘Ah! dear Zénocrite, here you come leading our new
<i>bergère</i>,’ cries the lady on the couch. ‘Welcome,
Mademoiselle, I have been waiting with impatience to
make your acquaintance.’</p>

<p>Madeleine curtseys and says with an indescribable
mixture of modesty and pride:—</p>

<p>‘Surely the world-famed amiability of Madame is, if I
may use the expression, at war with her judgment, or
rather, for two such qualities of the last excellence must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
ever be as united as Orestes and Pylades, some falsely
flattering rumour has preceded me to the shell of Madame’s
ear.’</p>

<p>‘Say rather some Zephyr, for such always precede
Flora,’ one of the gallants says in a low voice to another.</p>

<p>‘But no one, I think,’ continues Madeleine, ‘will accuse
me of flattery when I say that the dream of one day joining
the pilgrims to the shrine of Madame was the fairest one
ever sent me from the gates of horn.’</p>

<p>‘Sappho, our <i>bergère</i> has evidently been initiated into
other mysteries than those of the rustic Pan,’ says
Arthénice, smiling to Mademoiselle de Scudéry, whom
Madeleine hardly dares to visualise, but feels near, a filmy
figure in scanty, classic attire.</p>

<p>Madeleine turns to Sappho with a look at once respectful
and gallant, and smiling, says:—</p>

<p>‘That, Madame, is because being deeply read in the
Sibylline Books—which is the name I have ventured to
bestow on your delicious romances—I need no other
initiation to <i>les rites galants</i>.’</p>

<p>‘I fear, Mademoiselle, that if the Roman Republic had
possessed only the Books that you call Sibylline, it would
have been burned to the ground by the great Hannibal,’
says Sappho with a smile.</p>

<p>‘Madame, it would have been of no consequence, for
the Sibyl herself would have taken captive the conqueror,’
answers Madeleine gallantly.</p>

<p>‘Ah, Sappho!’ cries the Princess Julie, ‘I perceive that
we Nymphs are being beaten by the Shepherdess in the
battle of flowers.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, no, Madame!’ Madeleine answers quickly. ‘Say
rather that the Shepherdess knows valleys where grow
wild flowers that are not found in urban gardens, and these
she ventures to twine into garlands to lay humbly at the
feet of the Nymphs.’ She pauses. Sappho, by half a
flicker of an eyelid, shows her that she knows the garlands
are all meant for her.</p>

<p>‘But, Mademoiselle, if you will pardon my curiosity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
what induced you to leave your agreeable prairies?’ asks
Mégabate.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur,’ answers Madeleine, smiling, ‘had you asked
Aristæus why he left the deserts of Libya, his answer
would have been the same as mine: “There is a Greece.”’</p>

<p>‘Was not Aristæus reared by the Seasons themselves and
fed upon nectar and ambrosia?’ asks Sappho demurely.</p>

<p>‘To be reared by the Seasons! What a ravishing fate!’
cries one of the gallants. ‘It is they alone who can give
the <i>real</i> roses and lilies, which blossom so sweetly on the
cheeks of Mademoiselle.’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur, one of the Seasons themselves brings the
refutation of your words. For Lady Winter brings ...
<i>la glace</i>,’ says Madeleine, with a look of delicious raillery.</p>

<p>‘But, indeed,’ she continues, ‘I must frankly admit
that my distaste for Bœotia (for that is what I call the
Provinces!) is as great as that felt for pastoral life by
Alcippe and Amaryllis in the <i>Astrée</i>. There is liberty in
the prairies, you may say, but any one who has read of
the magic palaces of Armide or Alcine in <i>Amadis de Gaule</i>,
would, rather than enjoy all the liberty of all the sons of
Boreas, be one of the <i>blondines</i> imprisoned in the palace
of the present day Armide,’ and she bows to Arthénice.</p>

<p>‘I do not care for <i>Amadis de Gaule</i>,’ says Sappho a little
haughtily. Madeleine thrills with indescribable triumph.
Can it be possible that Sappho is jealous of the compliment
paid to Arthénice?</p>

<span class="smaller">THE GRECIAN PROTOTYPE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>During the days that followed, Madeleine wallowed in
Semi-Pelagianism. With grateful adoration, she worshipped
the indulgent God, who had hung upon a
Cross that everything she asked might be given her.</p>

<p>As a result of this new-found spiritual peace, she
became much more friendly and approachable at home.
She even listened with indulgence to her father’s
egotistical crudities, and to her mother’s hopes of her
scoring a great success on the following Wednesday
when the Troguins were giving a ball. Seeing that her
imprisonment in the bourgeois world of pale reflections
was so nearly over, and that she would so soon be
liberated to the plane of Platonic ideas and face to face
with the <i>real</i> Galanterie, the <i>real</i> Esprit, the <i>real</i> Fashion,
she could afford a little tolerance.</p>

<p>Then, in accordance with her promise to the Virgin,
she insisted on helping her mother in the work of the
house. Madame Troqueville would perhaps be sewing,
Madeleine would come up to her and say in a voice
of resigned determination: ‘Mother, if you will but
give me precise instructions what to do, I will relieve
you of this business.’ Then, having wrested it from her
unwilling mother, she would leave it half finished and
run off to dance—feeling she had discharged her conscience.
The virtue did not lie in a thing accomplished,
but in doing something disagreeable—however useless.
The boredom of using her hands was so acute as to be
almost physical pain. It was as if the fine unbroken
piece of eternity in which her dreams took place turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
into a swarm of little separate moments, with rough,
prickly coats that tickled her in her most tender parts.
The prickly coats suggested thorns, and—the metaphor
breaking off, as it were, into a separate existence of its
own—she remembered that in the old story of her
childhood, it was thorns that had guarded the palace
of the hidden Princess. This association of ideas seemed
full of promise and encouraged her to persevere.</p>

<p>Many were the winks and leers of Berthe over this
new domesticity, which she chose to interpret in a
manner Madeleine considered unspeakably vulgar.
‘Ho! Ho!’ ... wink ... ‘Mademoiselle is studying
to be a housewife! Monsieur Jacques will be well
pleased.’ And when Madeleine offered to help her
wash some jabots and fichus, she said, with a mysterious
leer, that she was reminded of a story of her grandmother’s
about a girl called Nausicaa, but when Madeleine
asked to be told the story, she would only chuckle
mysteriously.</p>

<p>One evening she made a discovery that turned her
hopes into certainty.</p>

<p>After supper, she had given Jacques a signal to
follow her to her own room. It was not that she wanted
his society, but it was incumbent on her to convince
the gods that she loved him. She sat down on his knee
and caressed him. He said suddenly:—</p>

<p>‘I could scarce keep from laughing at supper when
my uncle was descanting on his diverse legal activities
and reciting the fine compliments paid him by judges
and advocates by the score! <i>Malepest!</i> So you do
not drive him to a nonplus with too close questionings,
but let him unmolested utter all his conceit, why then
his lies will give you such entertainment as——’</p>

<p>‘Have a care what you say, Jacques,’ she cried, ‘I’ll
not have my father called a liar. It may be that he
paints the truth in somewhat gaudy colours, but all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
said, ’tis a good-natured man, and I am grateful to him
in that being exercised as to the material welfare of my
mother and myself, he came to Paris to better our fortunes.
Jacques! Have done with your foolish laughter!’</p>

<p>But Jacques continued cackling with shrill, mocking
glee.</p>

<p>‘My aunt’s and your material welfare, forsooth!
This is most excellent diversion! If you but knew the
true cause of his leaving Lyons! If you but knew!’</p>

<p>‘Well, tell me.’</p>

<p>‘That I will not, sweet Chop! Oh, ’tis a most fantastic
nympholeptic! As passionate after dreams as is
his daughter.’</p>

<p>‘I am to seek as to your meaning, Jacques,’ said
Madeleine very coldly, and she slipped down from his
knee.</p>

<p>Jacques went on chuckling to himself: ‘To see him
standing there, nonplussed, and stammering, and most
exquisitely amorous.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘What’s that you are declaiming, Jacques?’</p>

<p>‘Some lines of the Grecian Sappho, turned into Latin
by Catullus, that figure, with an exquisite precision, the
commingling in a lover of passion and of bashfulness.’</p>

<p>The look of cold aloofness suddenly vanished from
Madeleine’s face.</p>

<p>‘The Grecian Sappho!’ she cried eagerly. ‘She is
but a name to me. Tell me of her.’</p>

<p>‘She was a poetess. She penned amorous odes to
diverse damsels, and then leapt into the sea,’ he answered
laconically, looking at her with rather a hostile light
in his bright eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>‘Repeat me one of her odes,’ she commanded, and
Jacques began in a level voice:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Deathless Dame Venus of the damasked throne,
daughter of Jove, weaver of wiles, I beseech thee tame
not my soul with frets and weariness, but if ever in time
past thou heard’st and hearkened to my cry, come hither
to me now. For having yoked thy chariot of gold thou
did’st leave thy father’s house and fair, swift swans, with
ceaseless whirring of wings over the sable earth did carry
thee from heaven through the midmost ether. Swift was
their coming, and thou, oh, blessed one, a smile upon thy
deathless face, did’st ask the nature of my present pain,
and to what new end I had invoked thee, and what, once
more, my frenzied soul was fain should come to pass.</p>

<p>‘“Who is she now that thou would’st fain have Peitho
lead to thy desire? Who, Sappho, does thee wrong?
<i>For who flees, she shall pursue; who spurns gifts, she shall
offer them; who loves not, willy-nilly she shall love.</i>”</p>

<p>‘Now, even now, come to me! Lift from me the weight
of hungry dreams, consummate whatever things my soul
desires, and do thou thyself fight by my side.’</p>

</div>

<p>He looked at her, his eyes screwed up into two hard,
bright points. Madeleine continued to gaze in front of
her—silent and impassive.</p>

<p>‘Well, is it to your liking?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘What?’ she cried with a start, as if she had been
awakened from a trance. ‘Is it to my liking? I can
scarcely say. To my mind ’tis ... er ... er to speak
ingenuously, somewhat blunt and crude, and lacking
in <i>galanterie</i>.’</p>

<p>He broke into a peal of gay laughter, the hostile look
completely vanished.</p>

<p>‘<i>Galanterie</i>, forsooth! Oh, Chop, you are a rare
creature! Hark’ee, in the “smithy of Vulcan,” as you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
would say, weapons are being forged of the good iron
of France—battle-axes <i>à la Rabelais</i>, and swords <i>à la
Montaigne</i>—and they will not tarry to smash up your
fragile world of <i>galanterie</i> and galimatias into a
thousand fragments.’</p>

<p>Madeleine in answer merely gave an abstracted
smile.</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville came in soon afterwards to turn
out Jacques and order Madeleine to bed. Madeleine
could see that she wanted to talk about the Troguin’s
ball, but she was in no mood for idle conjectures, and
begged her to leave her to herself.</p>

<p>As soon as she was alone she flung herself on her
knees and offered up a prayer of solemn triumphant
gratitude. That of her own accord she should have
come to the conclusion reached centuries ago by the
Paris Sappho’s namesake—that the perfect <i>amitié
tendre</i> can exist only between two women—was a
coincidence so strange, so striking, as to leave no doubt
in her mind that her friendship with Mademoiselle de
Scudéry was part of the ancient, unalterable design of
the universe. Knowing this, how the Good Shepherd
must have laughed at her lack of faith!</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MERCHANTS OF DAMASCUS AND DAN</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Madeleine woke up the following morning to the
sense of a most precious new possession.</p>

<p>She got out of bed, and, after having first rubbed her
face and hands with a rag soaked in spirit, was splashing
them in a minute basin of water—her thoughts the
while in Lesbos—when the door opened and in walked
Madame Troqueville.</p>

<p>‘<i>Jésus!</i> Madeleine, it <i>cannot</i> be that you are <i>again</i> at
your washing!’ she cried in a voice vibrant with
emotion. ‘Why, as I live, ’twas but yesterday you did
it last. Say what you will, it will work havoc with your
sight and your complexion. I hold as naught in this
matter the precepts of your Précieuses. You need to
sponge yourself but once a week to keep yourself
fresh and sweet, a skin as fine and delicate as
yours——’</p>

<p>But Madeleine, trembling with irritation that her
mother should break into her pleasant reverie with such
prosaic and fallacious precepts, cried out with almost
tearful rage: ‘Oh, mother, let me be! What you say
is in the last of ignobility; ’tis the custom of all <i>honnêtes
gens</i> to wash their hands and face <i>each day</i>.... I’ll
not, not, <i>not</i> be a stinking bourgeoise!’</p>

<p>It was curious how shrill and shrewish these two
outwardly still and composed beings were apt to become
when in each other’s company.</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville shrugged her shoulders: ‘Well,
if you won’t be ruled! But let that go—I came to say
that we should do well to go to the Foire Saint-Germain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
this morning to provide you with some bravery for the
Troguin’s ball——’</p>

<p>‘The Troguin’s ball, forsooth! Ever harping on that
same string! Are you aware <i>that I am for the Hôtel de
Rambouillet</i> on Thursday? That surely is a more staid
and convenient event on which to hang your hopes!’</p>

<p>‘Is it?’ said Madame Troqueville, with a little smile.
‘Well, what shall you wear on that most pregnant day?
Your flowered ferrandine petticoat and your crimson
sarge bodice?’</p>

<p>Madeleine went rather pale; she rapped out in icy
tones: ‘<i>Les honnêtes gens</i> pronounce it <i>serge</i>. Leave
me, please ... I have the caprice to dress myself
unaided this morning.’</p>

<p>Once alone, Madeleine flung herself on her bed, clutched
her head in her hands and gave little, short, sharp moans.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was this—that when, in her
dances, she rehearsed her visit to the Hôtel de Rambouillet,
she pictured herself dressed in a very <i>décolleté</i>
bodice of <i>céladon</i> velvet sparkling with jewels and
shrouded in priceless Italian lace, a petticoat of taffetas
dotted with countless knots of ribbon, and green silk
stockings with rose-coloured clocks. Until this moment,
when her mother, with her irritating sense of reality,
had brought her face to face with facts, it had never so
much as occurred to her that nothing of this bravery
existed outside her own imagination. Yes, it was true!
a serge bodice and a ferrandine petticoat were all the
finery her wardrobe could provide. Was she then to
make her début at the Palace of Arthénice as a dingy
little bourgeoise? What brooked the Grecian Sappho
and her conceits, what brooked the miraculous nature
of Madame Cornuel’s invitation if the masque of reality
was to lack the ‘ouches and spangs’ of dreams? Well,
God had made the path of events lead straight to
Mademoiselle de Scudéry, could He not too turn her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
mother’s purse into that of Fortunatus? She could but
go to the Fair—and await a miracle.</p>

<p>As they made their way along the bank of the Seine,
Madame Troqueville was wrapt in pleasant reverie.
None of the wealthy young bourgeoises at the ball
would look as delicate and fine as her Madeleine ...
what if she took the fancy of some agreeable young
magistrate, with five or six different posts in the <i>Parlement</i>,
and a flat, red house with white facings in the Place
Dauphine, like the Troguins? Then he would ‘give
the Fiddles’ for a ball, and offer Madeleine a bouquet
in token that it was in her honour, then Madeleine would
‘give the Fiddles’ for a return ball.... The Troguins
would lend their house ... and then ... why not?
stranger things had happened.</p>

<p>‘A fragment of Lyons silk ... some <i>bisette</i> and
some <i>camelot de Hollande</i> ... a pair of shoes that you
may foot it neatly ... yes, you will look rare and
delicate, and ’twill go hard but one gold coin will furnish
us with all we need.’</p>

<p>Madeleine smiled grimly—unless she were much
mistaken, not even one <i>silver</i> coin would be squandered
on the Troguins’s ball.</p>

<p>They were now making their way towards two long rows
of wooden buildings in which was held the famous Fair.</p>

<p>In the evenings it was a favourite haunt of beauty and
fashion, but in the mornings it was noisy with all the
riff-raff of the town—country cousins lustily bawling
‘Stop, thief!’; impudent pages; coarse-tongued musketeers;
merchant’s wives with brazen tongues and sharp,
ruthless elbows; dazzled Provincials treating third-rate
courtesans to glasses of <i>aigre de cèdre</i> and the delicious
cakes for which the Fair was famous.</p>

<p>Through this ruthless, plangent, stinking crowd,
Madame Troqueville and Madeleine pushed their way,
with compressed lips and faces pale with disgust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>Of a sudden, their ears were caught by the cry:—</p>

<p>‘Galants pour les dames! Faveurs pour les galants!
Rubans d’écarlate, de cramoisie, et de Cé-la-don!’</p>

<p>It came from a little man of Oriental appearance,
sitting at a stall that contained nothing but knots of
ribbon of every colour, known as <i>galants</i>.</p>

<p>When he caught sight of Madeleine, he waved before
her one of pale green.</p>

<p>‘A <i>céladon galant</i> for the young lady—a figure of
the perfect lover,’ he called out. ‘Mademoiselle cannot
choose but buy it!’ Céladon, the perfect lover, in the
famous romance called <i>Astrée</i>, had given his name to a
certain shade of green.</p>

<p>Madeleine, thinking the words of good omen, pinched
her mother’s arm and said she <i>must</i> have it. After a
good deal of bargaining, they got it for more than
Madame Troqueville had intended spending on a pair
of shoes, and with a wry little smile, she said:—</p>

<p>‘Enough of these childish toys! Let us now to more
serious business,’ and once more began to push her way
through the hateful, seething crowd.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Madeleine again pinched her mother’s arm,
and bade her stop. They were passing the stall of a
mercer—a little man with black, beady eyes, leering
at them roguishly from among his delicate merchandise.</p>

<p>‘Here is most rare Italian lace,’ said Madeleine, with
a catch in her voice.</p>

<p>‘Ay, here, for example, is a piece of <i>point de Gênes</i>
of most exquisite design,’ broke in the mercer’s wife—an
elegant lady, with a beautifully dressed head of
hair, ‘I sold just such a piece, a week come Thursday,
to the Duchesse de Liancourt.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! but if one be fair and young and juicy ’tis the
transparent <i>point de Venise</i> that is best accordant with
one’s humour,’ interrupted the mercer, with a wink at
Madeleine. ‘’Tis the <i>point de Venise</i> that discovers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
the breasts, Mademoiselle! Which, being so, I vow
the names should be reversed, and the <i>transparent</i>
fabric be called <i>point de Gênes</i>, <i>hein</i>? <i>Point de gêne!</i>’
and he gleefully chuckled over his own wit, while his
wife gave him a good-natured push and told him with
a grin not to be a fool.</p>

<p>‘Whatever laces you may stock, good sir, no one can
with truth affirm that you have—<i>point d’Esprit</i>,’ said
Madeleine graciously.</p>

<p>‘Come, my child!’ said Madame Troqueville, with
a smile, and prepared to move away. This put the
mercer on his mettle.</p>

<p>‘Ladies, you would be well advised to tarry a while
with me!’ he cried, in the tones of a disinterested
adviser. ‘Decked in these delicate toys you would
presently learn how little serves, with the help of art,
to adorn a great deal. Let a lady be of any form or any
quality, after a visit to my stall she’d look a Marquise!’</p>

<p>‘Nay, say rather that she’d look a Duchesse,’ amended
his wife.</p>

<p>‘Come, my child!’ said Madame Troqueville again.</p>

<p>‘Nay, lady, there is good sense in what I say!’
pleaded the mercer, ‘the very pith of modishness is in
my stall. A <i>galant</i> of gay ribbons, and a fichu of fine
point—such as this one, for example—in fact the trifling
congeries which in the dress of <i>gallants</i> is known as
“<i>petite oie</i>” will lend to the sorriest <i>sarge</i> the lustre
of velvet!’</p>

<p>Madeleine’s eyes were blazing with excitement. God
had come to her rescue once again, and forgoing,
with the economy of the true artist, the meretricious
aid of a material miracle, had solved her problem in
the simplest manner by the agency of this little mercer.
To cut a brave figure on Thursday, there was no need
of Fortunatus’s purse. Her eyes had been opened.
Of course, as in manners, so in dress, the days of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
solidity were over. Who now admired the heavy
courtesy of the school of the Admiral de Bassompière in
comparison with the careless, mocking grace of the <i>air
galant</i>? In the same way, she, twirling a little cane in
her hand, motley with ribbons, her serge bodice trimmed
with the <i>pierreries du Temple</i> (of which, by the way,
more anon), with some delicate trifles from the mercer’s
stall giving a finish to the whole, could with a free mind,
allow three-piled velvet and strangely damasked silk
to feed the moths in the brass-bound, leather chests
that slumber in châteaux, far away mid the drowsy
foison of France.</p>

<p>With strange, suppressed passion, she pleaded with
her mother, first, for a Holland handkerchief, edged
with Brussels lace, and caught up at the four corners
by orange-coloured ribbon; then for a pair of scented
gloves, also hung with ribbons; then for a bag of rich
embroidery for carrying her money and her Book of
Hours. And Madame Troqueville, under the spell of Madeleine’s
intense desire, silently paid for one after another.</p>

<p>They left the mercer’s stall, having spent three
times over the coin that Madame Troqueville had
dedicated to the Troguins’s ball. Suddenly, she realised
what had happened, and cried out in despair:—</p>

<p>‘I have done a most inconsiderate, rash, weak thing!
How came it that I countenanced such shameless, such
fantastic prodigality? I fear——’</p>

<p>‘Mother, by that same prodigality I have purchased
my happiness,’ said Madeleine solemnly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my foolish love! ’Tis only children that find their
happiness in toys,’ and her mother laughed, in spite of
herself. ‘Well, our purse will not now rise above a piece
of ferrandine. We must see what we can contrive.’</p>

<p>They walked on, Madeleine in an ecstasy of happiness—last
night, the Grecian Sappho, this morning, God’s wise
messenger, the mercer—the Lord was indeed on her side!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>They were passing the stall of a silk merchant. He
was a tight-lipped, austere-looking old man, and he
was listening to an elderly bourgeoise, whose expression
was even more severe than his own. The smouldering
fire in her eye and the harsh significance of her voice,
touched their imagination, and they stopped to listen.</p>

<p>‘Ay, as the Prophet tells us, the merchants of
Damascus and Dan and Arabia brought in singing
ships to the fairs of Tyre, purple, and broidered work,
and fine linen, and coral, and agate, and blue clothes
in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made
of cedar. And where now is Tyre, Master Petit?’</p>

<p>‘Tyre, with its riches and its fairs, and its merchandise
and its mariners fell into the midst of the seas
in the day of its ruin,’ solemnly chanted in reply Master
Petit. Evidently neither he nor the lady considered the
words to have any application either to himself or to
the costly fabrics in which he was pleased to traffic.</p>

<p>‘Vanity of vanities! ’Tis a lewd and sinful age,’
said the lady, with gloomy satisfaction, ‘I know one old
vain, foolish fellow who keeps in my attic a suit of
tawdry finery in which to visit bawdy-houses, as if,
forsooth, all the purple and fine linen of Solomon himself
could add an ounce of comeliness to his antic,
foolish face! He would be better advised to lay up
the white garment of salvation with sprigs of the
lavender of grace, in a coffer of solid gold, where neither
moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not
break through and steal. I do oft-times say to him:
“Monsieur Troqueville——”’</p>

<p>‘Come, my child,’ said Madame Troqueville quietly,
moving away.</p>

<p>So this was what Jacques had meant by his mysterious
hints the night before! Madeleine followed her mother
with a slight shudder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">‘RITE DE PASSAGE’</span></h3>

</div>

<p>At about six o’clock on Wednesday evening a hired
coach came to take them to the Troguin’s. To a casual
eye it presented a gorgeous appearance of lumbering
gilt, but Madeleine noticed the absence of curtains, the
straw leaking out of the coachman’s cushion, and the
jaded, shabby horses. Jacques had arranged that a
band of his devoted clerks of <i>la Bazoche</i>, armed with
clubs, should follow the coach to the Île Notre Dame,
for the streets of Paris were infested by thieves and
assassins, and it did not do to be out after dusk unarmed
and unattended. On ordinary occasions this grotesque
parody of the state of a Grand Seigneur—a hired coach,
and grinning hobbledehoys instead of lackeys, strutting
it, half proud, half sheepish, in their quaint blue and
yellow livery—would have nearly killed Madeleine with
mortification. To-night it rather pleased her, as a
piquant contrast to what was in store for her to-morrow
and onwards. For were not <i>all</i> doors to open to her
to-morrow—the doors of the Hôtel de Rambouillet, the
doors of the whole fashionable world, as well as the
doors of Mademoiselle de Scudéry’s heart? The
magical <i>petite-oie</i>, hidden away in her drawer at home,
and the miraculous manner in which her eyes had been
opened to its efficacy were certain earnests of success.
The whole universe was ablaze with good omens—to-morrow
‘the weight of hungry dreams’ would drop
from her, and her soul would get what it desired.</p>

<p>She found herself remembering with some perplexity
that in romances the siege of a lady’s heart was a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
long affair. Perhaps the instantaneous yielding of the
fortress, which she felt certain would be the case with
Mademoiselle de Scudéry when they met, was not quite
in the best traditions of <i>Galanterie</i>. It was annoying,
but inevitable, for she felt that any further delay
would kill her.</p>

<p>The Troguins lived in the new, red-brick triangle of
houses called la Place Dauphine, facing the bronze statue
of Henri IV., and backed by Notre-Dame.</p>

<p>Lackeys holding torches were standing on the steps
of their house, that the guests might have no trouble
in finding it.</p>

<p>After having taken off their cloaks and pattens, the
Troquevilles went into the ball-room. Here were countless
belles and gallants, dressed in white, carnation,
and sea-water green, which, on the authority of a very
grave writer, we know to be the colours that show best
by candle-light. Here and there this delicate mass
of colour was freaked with the sombre <i>soutanes</i> of
magistrates and the black silk of dowagers. The
Four Fiddles could be heard tuning up through the
hubbub of mutual compliments. Madeleine felt as if
she were gazing at it all from some distant planet.
Then Madame Troguin bustled up to them.</p>

<p>‘Good-evening, friends, you are exceeding welcome.
You must all have a glass of Hippocras to warm you.
It operates so sweetly on the stomach. I am wont to
say a glass of Hippocras is better than any purge.
I said as much to Maître Patin—our doctor, you know—and
he said——’</p>

<p>Madeleine heard no more, for she suddenly caught
sight of her father’s shining, eager eyes and anxious
smile, ‘his vanity itching for praise,’ she said to herself
scornfully. She saw him make his way to where the
youngest Troguin girl was sitting on a <i>pliant</i> with
several young men on their cloaks at her feet. How<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
could he be such an idiot, Madeleine wondered, he
<i>must</i> know that the Troguin girl did not want to
talk to <i>him</i> just then. But there he stood, hawking
and spitting and smirking. Now he was sitting
down on a <i>pliant</i> beside her ... how angry the
young men were looking ... Madeleine was almost
certain she saw the Troguin girl exchange a look of despair
with one of them. Now, from his arch gesture, she could
see that he was praising the outline of her breasts and
regretting the jabot that hid them.... <i>Jésus!</i> his
provinciality! it was at least ten years ago since it
had been fashionable to praise a lady’s breasts! So
her thoughts ran on, while every moment she felt more
irritated.</p>

<p>Then the fiddles struck up the air of ‘Sur le pont
d’Avignon,’ and the whole company formed up into
circles for the opening <i>Branle</i>.</p>

<p>There was her father, grimacing and leaping like a
baboon in a nightmare, grave magistrates capering like
foals, and giving smacking kisses to their youthful
partners, young burghers shouting the words at the
top of their voices. The whole scene seemed to Madeleine
to grow every minute more unreal.</p>

<p>Then the fiddles stopped and the circles broke up
into laughing, breathless groups. A young bourgeois,
beplumed and beribboned, and wearing absurd thick
shoes, came up to her, and taking off his great hat by
the crown, instead of, in the manner of ‘<i>les honnêtes
gens</i>,’ by the brim, made her a clumsy bow. He began
to ‘<i>galantise</i>’ her. Madeleine wondered if he had learned
the art from the elephant at a fair. She fixed him
with her great, still eyes. Then she found herself forced
to lead him out to dance a <i>Pavane</i>. The fiddles were
playing a faint, lonely tune, full of the sadness of light
things bound to a ponderous earth, for these were the
days before Lulli had made dance tunes gay. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
beautiful pageant had begun—the <i>Pavane</i>, proud and
preposterous as a peacock or a Spaniard. Then some
old ladies sitting round the room began in thin, cracked
voices to sing according to a bygone fashion, the
words of the dance:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Approche donc, ma belle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Approche-toi, mon bien;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne me sois plus rebelle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Puisque mon cœur est tien;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pour mon âme apaiser,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Donne mois un baiser.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">They beat time with their fans, and their eyes filled with
tears. Gradually the song was taken up by the whole
room, the words rising up strong and triumphant:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Approche donc, ma belle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Approche-toi, mon bien——’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Madeleine’s lips were parted into a little smile, and her
spellbound eyes filled with tears; then she saw Jacques
looking at her and his eyes were bright and mocking.
She blushed furiously.</p>

<p>‘He is like Hylas, the mocking shepherd in the <i>Astrée</i>,’
she told herself. ‘Hylas, hélas, Hylas, hélas,’ she
found herself muttering.</p>

<p>After another pause for <i>Galanterie</i> and preserved
fruits, the violins broke into the slow, voluptuous
rhythm of the Saraband. The old ladies again beat
time with their fans, muttering ‘vraiment cela donne
à rêver.’</p>

<p>Madeleine danced with Jacques and he never took
his eyes from her face, but hers were fixed and glassy,
and the words of the Sapphic Ode, ‘that man seems to
me the equal of the gods’ ... clothed itself, as with
a garment, with the melody.</p>

<p>She was awakened from her reverie by feeling Jacques’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
grasp suddenly tighten on her hand. She looked at
him, he was white and scowling. A ripple of interest
was passing over the dancers, and all eyes were turned
to the door. Two or three young courtiers had just
come in, attracted by the sound of the fiddles. For in
those days courtiers claimed a vested right to lounge
uninvited into any bourgeois ball, and they were always
sure of an obsequious welcome.</p>

<p>There was the Président Troguin puffily bowing to
them, and the Présidente bobbing and smirking and
offering refreshment. Young Brillon, the giver of the
fiddles, had left his partner, Marguerite Troguin, and
was standing awkwardly half-way to the door, unable
to make up his mind whether he should doff his hat to
the courtiers before they doffed theirs to him; but they
rudely ignored all three, and, swaggering up to the
fiddles, bade them stop playing.</p>

<p>‘<i>Foi de gentilhomme</i>, I vow that it is of the last
consequence that this Saraband should die. It is really
ubiquitous,’ lisped one of them, a little <i>muguet</i>, with
a babyish face.</p>

<p>‘It must be sent to America with the Prostitutes,’
said another.</p>

<p>‘That is furiously well turned, Vicomte. Really it
deserves to be put to the torture.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, because it is a danger to the kingdom, it debases
the coinage.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because it generates tender emotions in so many
vulgar bosoms turning thus the fine gold of Cupid into
a base alloy!’</p>

<p>‘Bravo! Comte, tu as de l’esprit infiniment.’</p>

<p>During this bout of wit, the company had been quite
silent, trying hard to look amused, and in the picture.</p>

<p>‘My friends, would you oblige us with the air of a
<i>Corante</i>?’ the Vicomte called out with a familiar wink<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
to the ‘Four Fiddles,’ with whom it behoved every
fashionable gallant to be on intimate terms. The
‘Fiddles’ with an answering wink, started the tune of
this new and most fashionable dance.</p>

<p>‘Ah! I breathe again!’ cried the little Marquis.
They then proceeded to choose various ladies as partners,
discussing their points, as if they had been horses at a
Fair. The one they called Comte, a tall, military
looking man, chose Marguerite Troguin, at which
Brillon tried to assert himself by blustering out that the
lady was <i>his</i> partner. But the Comte only looked him
up and down, with an expression of unutterable disgust,
and turning to the Marquis, asked: ‘What <i>is</i> this <i>thing</i>?’
Brillon subsided.</p>

<p>Then they started the absurd <i>Corante</i>. The jumping
steps were performed on tip-toe, and punctuated by
countless bows and curtseys. There was a large
audience, as very few of the company had yet learned
it. When it was over, it was greeted with enthusiastic
applause.</p>

<p>The courtiers proceeded to refresh themselves with
Hippocras and lemonade. Suddenly the little Marquis
seized the cloak of the Comte, and piped out in an
excited voice:—</p>

<p>‘Look, Comte, over there ... I swear it is our old
friend, the ghost of the fashion of 1640!’</p>

<p>‘It is, it is, it’s the black shadow of the white Ariane!
The <i>crotesque</i> and importunate gallant!’ They made a
dash for Monsieur Troqueville, who was trying hard to
look unconscious, and leaping round him beset him
with a volley of somewhat questionable jests. All eyes
were turned on him, eyebrows were raised, questioning
glances were exchanged. Madame Troqueville sat quite
motionless, gazing in front of her, determined not to
hear what they were saying. She would <i>not</i> be forced
to see things too closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>When they had finished with Monsieur Troqueville,
they bowed to the Présidente, studiously avoiding the
rest of the company in their salutation, and, according
to their picture of themselves, minced or swaggered out
of the room. Jacques followed them.</p>

<p>This interlude had shaken Madeleine out of her
vastly agreeable dreams. The <i>muguets</i> had made her
feel unfinished and angular, and they had not even
asked her to dance. Then, their treatment of her father
had been a sharp reminder that after all she was by
birth nothing but a contemptible bourgeoise. But as
the evening’s gaiety gradually readjusted itself, so did
her picture of herself, and by the time of the final
<i>Branle</i>, she was once more drunk with vanity and
hope.</p>

<p>The Troguins sent them back in their own coach,
and the drive through the fantastic Paris of the night
accentuated Madeleine’s sense of being in a dream.
There passed them from time to time troops of tipsy
gallants, their faces distorted by the flickering
lights of torches, and here and there the <i>lanternes vives</i>
of the pastry-cooks—brilliantly-lighted lanterns round
whose sides, painted in gay colours, danced a string of
grimacing beasts, geese, and apes, and hares and
elephants—showed bright and strange against the
darkness.</p>

<p>Then the words:—</p>

<p><i>La joie! la joie! Voilà des oublies!</i> echoed melancholy
in the distance. It was the cry of the <i>Oublieux</i>,
the sellers of wafers and the nightingales of seventeenth
century Paris, for they never began to cry their wares
before dusk.</p>

<p><i>La joie! la joie! Voilà des oublies!</i></p>

<p><i>Oublie, oublier!</i> The second time that evening there
came into Madeleine’s head a play on words.</p>

<p><i>La joie! la joie! Voilà des oublies!</i> Could it be that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the secret of <i>la joie</i> was nothing but this dream-sense
and—<i>l’oubli</i>?</p>

<p>They found Jacques waiting for them, pale but
happy. He would not tell them why he had left the
ball-room, but he followed Madeleine to her room.
He was limping. And then, with eyes bright with
triumph, he described how, at their exit from the ball-room,
he had rallied the <i>Clercs</i> of the <i>Bazoche</i> (they
had stayed to play cards with the Troguin’s household),
how they had followed the courtiers, and, taking them
by surprise, had given them the soundest cudgelling
they had probably ever had in their lives. ‘Though
they put up a good fight!’ and he laughed ruefully
and rubbed his leg.</p>

<p>‘How came it that they knew my father?’ Madeleine
asked. Jacques grinned.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Chop, should I tell you, it would savour of the
blab ... yet, all said, I would not have you lose so
good a diversion ... were I to tell you, you would
keep my counsel?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>Then he proceeded to tell her that her father had
fallen in love in Lyons with a courtesan called Ariane.
She had left Lyons to drive her trade in Paris, and that
was the true cause of his sudden desire to do the same.
On reaching Paris, his first act was to buy from the
stage wardrobe of the Hôtel de Bourgogne, an ancient
suit of tawdry finery, which long ago had turned a
courtier into the Spirit of Spring in a Royal Ballet.
This he had hidden away in the attic of an old Huguenot
widow who kept a tavern on the Mont Sainte-Geneviève,
and had proceeded to pester Ariane with letters and
doggerel imploring an interview—but in vain! Finally,
he had taken his courage in both hands, and donning his
finery—‘which he held to have the virtue of the
cestus of Venus!’ laughed Jacques—he had boldly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
marched into Ariane’s bedroom, only to be received
by a flood of insults and ridicule by that lady and her
gallants.</p>

<p>Madeleine listened with a pale, set face. Why had
she been so pursued these last few days by her father’s
sordid <i>amours</i>?</p>

<p>‘So this ... Ariane ... rejected my father’s suit?’
she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>‘Ay, that she did! How should she not?’ laughed
Jacques.</p>

<p>‘And you gave your suffrage to the foolish enterprise?’</p>

<p>Jacques looked rather sheepish.</p>

<p>‘I am not of the stuff that can withstand so tempting
a diversion—why, ’twill be a jest to posterity! His
eager, foolish, obsequious face; <i>and</i> his tire! I’faith, I
would not have missed it for a kingdom!’ and he
tossed back his head and laughed delightedly.</p>

<p>Hylas, <i>hélas</i>!... Jacques was limping ... Vulcan
was lame, wasn’t he? ‘In the smithy of Vulcan weapons
are being forged that will smash up your world of
<i>galanterie</i> and galamatias into a thousand fragments!’</p>

<p>‘Why, Chop, you look sadly!’ he cried, with sudden
contrition. ‘’Tis finished and done with, and these
coxcombs’ impudence bred them, I can vouch for it,
a score of bruises apiece! Chop, come here! Why,
the most modish and <i>galant</i> folk have oftentimes had
the strangest <i>visionnaires</i> for fathers. There is Madame
de Chevreuse—who has not heard of the <i>naïvetés</i> and
<i>visions</i> of her father? And ’twas a strange madman
that begot the King himself!’ he said, thinking to have
found where the shoe pinched. But Madeleine remained
silent and unresponsive, and he left her.</p>

<p>Yes, why had she been so pursued these last few
days by her father’s <i>amours</i>? It was strange that love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
should have brought him too from Lyons! And he
too had set his faith on the magical properties of
bravery! What if.... Then there swept over her the
memory of the Grecian Sappho, driving a host of nameless
fears back into the crannies of her mind. Besides—<i>to-morrow</i>
began the new era!</p>

<p>She smiled ecstatically, and, tired though she was,
broke into a triumphant dance.</p>

<span class="smaller">AT THE HÔTEL DE RAMBOUILLET</span></h3>

</div>

<p>When Madeleine awoke next morning, the feeling she
had had over night of being in a dream had by no
means left her.</p>

<p>From the street rose the cries of the hawkers:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Ma belle herbe, anis fleur.’</p>

<p>‘A la fraîche, à la fraîche, qui veut boire?’</p>

<p>‘A ma belle poivée à mes beaux épinards! à mon bel
oignon!’</p>

</div>

<p>And then shrill and plaintive:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Vous désirez quelque cho-o-o-se?’</p>

</div>

<p>It was no longer a taunt but the prayer of a humble
familiar asking for its mistress’s orders, or, rather, of
Love the Pedlar waiting to sell her what she chose.
She opened her window and looked out. The length of
the narrow street the monstrous signs stuck out from
either side, heraldic lions, and sacred hearts, and blue
cats, and mothers of God, and <i>Maréchales</i> looking like
Polichinelle. It was as incongruous an assortment as
the signs of the Zodiac, as flat and fantastic as a pack
of cards——</p>

<p>‘<i>Vous désirez quelque cho-o-ose?</i>’ She laughed aloud.
Then she suddenly remembered her vague misgivings
of the night before. She drew in her head and rushed
to her divination book. These were the lines her eyes
fell upon:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘ ... and she seemed in his mind to have said a thousand
good things, which, in reality, she had not said at all.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>For one moment Madeleine’s heart seemed to stop
beating. Did it mean that she was not going to get in
her prepared mots? No, the true interpretation was
surely that Mademoiselle de Scudéry would think her
even more brilliant than she actually was. She fell
on her knees and thanked her kind gods in anticipation.</p>

<p>However, she too must do her part, must reinforce
the Power behind her, so over and over again she danced
out the scene at the Hôtel de Rambouillet, trying to
keep it exactly the same each time. ‘<i>Ah! dear Zénocrite!
here you come, leading our new Bergère.</i>’</p>

<p>All the morning she seemed in a dream, and her
mother, father, Jacques, and Berthe hundreds of miles
away. She could not touch a morsel of food. ‘Ah!
the little creature with wings. I know, I know,’ Berthe
kept muttering.</p>

<p>With her throat parched, and still in a strange, dry
dream, she went to dress. The magical <i>petite-oie</i> seemed
to her to take away all shabbiness from the serge bodice
and the petticoat of <i>camelot de Hollande</i>. Then, in a
flash, she remembered she had decided to add to her
purchases at the Fair a trimming of those wonderful
imitation jewels known as the <i>pierreries du Temple</i>.
The <i>petite-oie</i> had taken on the exigency of a magic
formulary, and its contents, to be efficacious, had to
conform as rigidly to the original conception as a
love-potion must to its receipt. In a few minutes she
would have to start, and the man who sold the stones
lived too far from Madame Cornuel for her to go there
first. She was in despair.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened, and in walked
Jacques; as a rule he did not come home till evening.
He sheepishly brought out of his hose an elaborate
arrangement of green beads.</p>

<p>‘Having heard you prate of the <i>pierreries du Temple</i>,
I’ve brought you these glass gauds. I fear me they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
aren’t from the man in the Temple, for I failed to find
the place ... but these seemed pretty toys. I thought
maybe they would help you to cut a figure before old
Dame Scudéry.’</p>

<p>It was truly a strange coincidence that he should have
brought her the very thing that at that very moment
she had been longing for. But was it the very thing?
For the first time that morning, Madeleine felt her
feet on earth. The beads were hideous and vulgar and
as unlike the <i>pierreries du Temple</i> as they were unlike
the emeralds they had taken as their model. She was
almost choked by a feeling of impotent rage.</p>

<p>How dare Jacques be such a ninny with so little
knowledge of the fashion? How dare he expect a belle
to care for him, when he was such a miserable gallant
with such execrable taste in presents? The idea of giving
<i>her</i> rubbish like that! She would like to kill him!</p>

<p>Always quick to see omens, her nerves, strung up
that morning to their highest pitch, felt in the gift the
most malignant significance. <i>Timeo Danaos et dona
ferentes</i>—I fear the Greeks even when they bear gifts.
She blanched, and furtively crossed herself. Having
said, in a dead voice, some words of thanks, she
silently pinned the bead trimming on to her bodice and
slowly left the room.</p>

<p>It was time to start; she got into the little box-like
sedan. There was her mother standing at the door,
waving her hand, and wishing her good luck. She
was soon swinging along towards the Seine.</p>

<p>When the house was out of sight, with rude, nervous
fingers she tore off the beads, and they fell in a shower
about the sedan. Though one could scarcely move in
the little hole, she managed to pick them all up, and
pulling back the curtain she flung them out of the
window. They were at that moment crossing the Pont-Neuf,
and she caught a glimpse of a crowd of beggars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
and pages scrambling to pick them up. Recklessly
scattering jewels to the rabble! It was like a princess
in <i>Amadis</i>, or like the cardinal’s nieces, the two Mancini,
whose fabulous extravagance was the talk of the town.
Then she remembered that they were only glass beads.
Was it an omen that her grandeur would be always a
mere imitation of the real thing? Also—though she
had got rid of the hateful trimming, her <i>petite-oie</i> was
still incomplete. Should she risk keeping Madame
Cornuel waiting and go first to the man in the Temple?
No, charms or no charms, she was moving on to her
destiny, and felt deadly calm. What she had prayed
for was coming and she could not stop it now. Its inevitableness
frightened her, and she began to feel a
poignant longing for the old order, the comforting
rhythm of the rut she was used to, with the pleasant
feeling of every day drawing nearer to a miraculous
transformation of her circumstances.</p>

<p>She pulled back the curtain again and peeped out,
the Seine was now behind them, and they were going
up la rue de la Mortellerie. Soon she would be in the
clutches of Madame Cornuel, and then there would be
no escape. Should she jump out of the sedan, or tell
the porters to take her home? She longed to; but if
she did, how was she to face the future? And what
ingratitude it would be for the exquisite tact with which
the gods had manipulated her meeting with Sappho!
the porters swung on and on, and Madeleine leaned back
and closed her eyes, hypnotised by the inevitable.</p>

<p>The shafts of the sedan were put down with a jerk,
and Madeleine started up and shuddered. One of the
porters came to the window. ‘Rue Saint-Antoine,
Mademoiselle.’ Madeleine gave him a coin to divide
with his companion, opened the door, and walked into
the court. Madame Cornuel’s coach was standing
waiting before the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>She walked in and was shown by a valet into an
ante-room. She sat down, and began mechanically
repeating her litany. Suddenly, there was a rich
rustle of taffeta, the door opened, and in swept a very
handsomely-dressed young woman. Madeleine knew
that it must be Mademoiselle le Gendre, the daughter
of Monsieur Cornuel’s first wife. In a flash Madeleine
took in the elegant continence of her toilette. While
Madeleine had seven patches on her face, she had only
three. Her hair was exquisitely neat, and she was only
slightly scented, while her deep, plain collar <i>à la Régente</i>,
gave an air of puritanic severity to the bright, cherry-coloured
velvet of her bodice. Also, she was not nearly
as <i>décolletée</i> as Madeleine.</p>

<p>Madeleine felt that all of a sudden her <i>petite-oie</i>
had lost both its decorative and magical virtue and had
become merely incongruous gawds on the patent shabbiness
of her gown. For some reason there flashed through
her head the words she had heard at the Fair: ‘As if
all the purple and fine linen of Solomon himself could
add an ounce of comeliness to his antic, foolish face.’</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle Troqueville? My step-mother awaits
us in the coach, will you come?’ said the lady. Her
manner was haughty and unfriendly. Madeleine
realised without a pang that it would all be like this.
But after all, nothing in this dull reality really mattered.</p>

<p>‘Bestir yourself! ’Tis time we were away!’ shouted
a voice from the <i>carrosse</i>. Mademoiselle le Gendre told
Madeleine to get in.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle Troqueville? I am glad to make your
acquaintance—pray get in and take the back seat
opposite me.’ Madeleine humbly obeyed, indifferent
to what in her imaginings she would have looked upon
as an unforgivable insult, the putting her in the back
seat.</p>

<p>‘Hôtel de Rambouillet,’ Madame Cornuel said to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
lackey, who was waiting for orders at the window.
The words left Madeleine quite cold.</p>

<p>Madame Cornuel and her step-daughter did not think
it necessary to talk to Madeleine. They exchanged
little remarks with each other at intervals, and laughed
at allusions which she could not catch.</p>

<p>‘Are we to fetch Sappho?’ suddenly asked the
younger woman.</p>

<p>‘No, she purposes coming later, and on foot.’</p>

<p>Madeleine heard the name without a thrill.</p>

<p>The coach rolled on, and Madeleine sat as if petrified.
Suddenly she galvanised herself into activity. In a few
minutes they would be there, and if she allowed herself
to arrive in this condition all would be lost. Why should
she let these two horrid women ruin her chance of
success? She muttered quickly to herself:—</p>

<p>‘Oh! blessed Virgin, give me the friendship of
Mademoiselle de Scudéry,’ and then started gabbling
through her prepared scene.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘“Ah, dear Zénocrite, here you come, leading our new
<i>bergère</i>!” cries the lady on the bed. “Welcome, Mademoiselle,
I have been waiting with impatience to make your
acquaintance.”’</p>

</div>

<p>Would she get it finished before they arrived? She
felt all her happiness depended on it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘“Madame, it would have been of no consequence, for the
Sibyl herself would have taken the conqueror captive....
But, Mademoiselle, what, if you will pardon my
curiosity, induced you to leave your agreeable prairies?”’</p>

</div>

<p>They were passing the Palais Cardinal—soon they
would turn down the rue St Thomas du Louvre—she
had not much time.</p>

<p>The coach was rolling into the court of the Hôtel de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Rambouillet and she had not finished. They got
out. A tall woman, aged about thirty, with reddish
hair and a face badly marked by smallpox, but in spite
of these two blemishes of an extremely elegant and distinguished
appearance, came towards them, screwing
up her eyes in the manner of the near-sighted. Her
top petticoat was full of flowers; she was too short-sighted
to recognise Madame Cornuel till she was quite
close, then she dropped a mock-low curtsey, and drawled
‘Ma-a-a-dame.’ Madame Cornuel laughed: evidently
she had imitated a mutual acquaintance. With a
sudden sense of exclusion Madeleine gave up hope.</p>

<p>‘Are you following the example of our friend of the
Faubourg St-Germain, may I inquire?’ asked Madame
Cornuel, with a little smile, pointing to the flowers,
at which her step-daughter laughed, and the tall red-haired
lady made a <i>moue</i> and answered with a deep
sigh:—</p>

<p>‘Ah! the wit of the Marais!’ The meaning of this
esoteric persiflage was entirely lost on Madeleine, and
she sat with an absolutely expressionless face, trying
to hide her own embarrassment.</p>

<p>‘Ah! pardon me, I had forgotten,’ Madame Cornuel
exclaimed. ‘Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, allow me
to present to you Mademoiselle Troqueville.’ (It may
have been Madeleine’s imagination, but it seemed to
her that Madame Cornuel paused before calling her
Mademoiselle.) Mademoiselle de Rambouillet screwed
up her eyes at her and smiled quite pleasantly, while
Madeleine, absolutely tongue-tied, tried to perform the
almost impossible task of curtseying in a coach. They
got out, and went inside, the three others continuing
their mystifying conversation.</p>

<p>They went up a staircase and through one large
splendid room after another. So here was Madeleine,
actually in the famous ‘Palais de Cléomire,’ as it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
called in <i>Cyrus</i>, but the fact did not move her, indeed
she did not even realise it. Once Mademoiselle de
Rambouillet turned round and said to her:—</p>

<p>‘I fear ’tis a long journey, Mademoiselle,’ but the
manner in which she screwed up her eyes both terrified
and embarrassed her, so instead of answering she
merely blushed and muttered something under her
breath.</p>

<p>Finally they reached Madame de Rambouillet’s bedroom
(she had ceased for some years to receive in the
<i>Salle Bleue</i>). She was lying on a bed in an alcove and
there were several people in the <i>ruelle</i>; as the thick
velvet curtains of the windows were drawn Madeleine
got merely an impression of rich, rare objects glowing
like jewels out of the semi-darkness, but in a flash she
took in the appearance of Madame de Rambouillet.
Her face was pale and her lips a bright crimson, which
was obviously not their natural colour; she had large
brown eyes with heavy pinkish eyelids, and the only
sign that she was a day over fifty was a slight trembling
of the head. She was wearing a loose gown of some
soft gray material, and on her head were <i>cornettes</i> of
exquisite lace trimmed with pale yellow ribbons. One
of her hands was lying on the blue coverlet, it was so
thin that its veins looked almost like the blue of the
coverlet shining through. The fingers were piled up
with beautiful rings.</p>

<p>There was a flutter round the bed, and then Madeleine
found herself being presented to the Marquise.</p>

<p>‘Ah! Mademoiselle Toctin, I am ravished to make
your acquaintance,’ she said in a wonderfully melodious
voice, with a just perceptible Italian accent. ‘You
come from delicious Marseilles, do you not? You will
be able to recount to us strange Orient romances of
orange-trees and Turkish soldiers. Angélique, bring
Mademoiselle Touville a <i>pliant</i>, and place it close to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
me, and I will warm myself at her Southern
<i>historiettes</i>.’</p>

<p>‘It is from Lyons that I come, not from Marseilles,’
was the only repartee of which at the moment Madeleine
was capable. Her voice sounded strange and harsh,
and she quite forgot a ‘Madame.’ However, the Marquise
did not hear, as she had turned to another guest. But
Angélique de Rambouillet heard, and so did another
lady, with an olive complexion and remarkably bright
eyes, whom Madeleine guessed to be Madame de Montausier,
the famous ‘Princesse Julie.’ They exchanged
glances of delight, and Madeleine began to blush, and
blush, though, as a matter of fact, it was by their
mother they were amused.</p>

<p>In the meantime a very tall, elderly man, with a
hatchet face, came stumbling towards her.</p>

<p>‘You have not a chair, have you, Mademoiselle?’</p>

<p>‘Here it is, father,’ said Angélique, who was bringing
one up.</p>

<p>‘Ah! that is right, Mademoiselle er ... er ... er
... will sit here.’</p>

<p>Madeleine took to this kind, polite man, and felt a
little happier. He sat down beside her and made a
few remarks, which Madeleine, full of the will to be
agreeable, answered as best she could, endeavouring to
make up by pleasant smiles for her sudden lack of
<i>esprit</i>. But, unfortunately, the Marquis was almost
stone-blind, so the smiles were lost upon him, and before
long Madeleine noticed by his absent laugh and amused
expression that his attention was wandering to the
conversation of the others.</p>

<p>‘I am of opinion you would look inexpressibly <i>galant</i>
in a scarlet hat, Marquis,’ Madame de Rambouillet was
saying to a short, swarthy man with a rather saturnine
expression. They all looked at him mischievously.
‘Julie would be obliged to join Yvonne in the Convent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
but there would be naught to hinder you from keeping
Marie-Julie at your side as your <i>adopted</i> daughter.’
The company laughed a little, the laugh of people too
thoroughly intimate to need to make any effort. ‘Monsieur
de Grasse is wearing his episcopal smile—look at
him, pray! Come, Monseigneur, you <i>must</i> confess
that a scarlet hat would become him to a marvel,’
and Madame de Rambouillet turned her brilliant,
mischievous eyes on a tiny prelate with a face like
a naughty schoolboy’s.</p>

<p>He had been called Monsieur de Grasse. Could he,
then, be the famous Godeau, bishop and poet? It
seemed impossible. For Saint Thomas is the patron
saint of provincials when they meet celebrities in the
flesh.</p>

<p>‘I fear Monsieur’s head would be somewhat too <i>large</i>
to wear it with comfort,’ he answered.</p>

<p>‘Hark to the episcopal <i>fleurette</i>! Marquis, rise up
and bow!’ but the only answer from the object of these
witticisms was a surly grunt. Another idle smile rippled
round the circle, and then there fell a silence of comfortable
intimacy. If Madeleine had suddenly found
herself in the kingdom of Prester John she could not
have understood less of what was going on around her.</p>

<p>‘Madame Cornuel has a furiously <i>galante historiette</i>
she is burning to communicate to us,’ said Mademoiselle
de Rambouillet, screwing up her eyes at Madame Cornuel.</p>

<p>‘Julie, bid Monsieur de Grasse go upstairs to play
with Marie-Julie, and then Madame Cornuel will
tell it.’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur de Grasse——’</p>

<p>‘Madame la Marquise come to my rescue! I too
would fain hear the <i>historiette</i>!’</p>

<p>‘Nolo episcopari, hein?’</p>

<p>‘Now, then, be obedient, and get you to Marie-Julie!’</p>

<p>‘Where can I take refuge?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>‘If there were a hazel-nut at hand, ’twould serve
your purpose.’</p>

<p>‘No, Madame la Marquise, permit me to hide within
your locket.’</p>

<p>‘As you will. Now, Madame, we are all attention.’</p>

<p>Throughout this fooling, Madeleine had sat with
aching jaws stretched into a smile, trying desperately
hard not to look out of it. They all looked towards
Madame Cornuel, who sat smiling in unruffled silence.</p>

<p>‘Madame?’</p>

<p>‘Well, Mademoiselle, tell me who is to be its heroine,
who its hero, and what its plot, and then I will recount
it to you,’ she said. They seemed to think this very
witty, and laughed heartily. There was another pause,
and Madeleine again made an attempt to engage the
Marquis’s attention.</p>

<p>‘The ... the ... the houses in Paris ... seem
to me most goodly structures,’ she began. He gave his
nervous laugh.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, we have some rare architects these days.
Have you been to see the new buildings of the Val de
Grâce?’</p>

<p>‘No, I have not ... er ... it is a Convent, is it not?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. Under the patronage of Notre Dame de la
Crêche.’</p>

<p>His attention began to wander again; she made a
frantic effort to rekindle the flames of the dying topic.</p>

<p>‘What a strange name it is—Val de Grâce, what do
you think can be its meaning?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes,’ with his nervous laugh, ‘Val de Grâce,
doubtless there is some legend connected with it.’</p>

<p>Madeleine gave up in despair.</p>

<p>The languid, intimate talk and humorous silences
had suddenly turned into something more animated.</p>

<p>‘Madame de Sablé vows that she saw her there with
her own eyes, and that she was dressed in a <i>justaucorps</i>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>‘Sophie has seen more things than the legendary
Argos!’</p>

<p>‘Well, it has been turned into a Vaudeville in her
quarter.’</p>

<p>‘In good earnest, has it? What an excellent diversion!
Julie, pray ask Madame d’Aiguillon about it
and tell us. Go to-day.’</p>

<p>‘I daren’t; “my dear, my dear, <i>cela fait dévotion</i>
and that puts me in mind, the Reine-Mère got a special
chalice of Florentine enamel and I must——” Roqueten,
Roqueten, Roquetine.’</p>

<p>‘Upon my life, the woman’s talk has less of
meaning than a magpie’s!’ growled Madeleine to
herself.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened and in came a
tall, middle-aged woman, swarthy, and very ugly. She
was dressed in a plain gown of gray serge. Her face
was wreathed in an agreeable smile, that made her
look like a civil horse.</p>

<p>Madeleine had forgotten all about Mademoiselle de
Scudéry, but when this lady came in, it all came rushing
back; she got cold all over, and if before she had
longed to be a thousand miles away, she now longed to
be ten thousand.</p>

<p>There was a general cry of:—</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle: the very person we were in need
of. You know everything. Tell us all about the
Présidente Tambonneau, but avoid, in your narration,
an excessive charity.’</p>

<p>‘If you talk with the tongues of men and of Angels
and yet <i>have</i> Charity, ye are become as sounding brass
and as a tinkling cymbal,’ said Madame Cornuel in her
clear, slow voice. She spoke rarely, but when she did
it was with the air of enunciating an oracle.</p>

<p>‘Humph! That is a fault that <i>you</i> are rarely guilty
of!’ growled Montausier quite audibly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>‘The Présidente Tambonneau? No new extravagance
of hers has reached my ears. What is there to tell?’
said the new-comer. She spoke in a loud, rather rasping
voice, and still went on smiling civilly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you ladies of the Marais, every one is aware
that you are omniscient, and yet you are perfect misers
of your <i>historiettes</i>!’</p>

<p>‘Sappho, we must combine against the <i>quartier du
Palais Cardinal</i>, albeit they <i>do</i> call us “omniscient.”
It sounds infinitely <i>galant</i>, but I am to seek as to its
meaning,’ said Madame Cornuel.</p>

<p>‘Ask Mademoiselle, she is in the last intimacy with
the <i>Maréchal des mots</i>; it is reported he has raised a
whole new company to fight under his <i>Pucelle</i>.’</p>

<p>‘From all accounts, she is in sore need of support,
poor lady. Madame de Longueville says she is
“<i>parfaitement belle mais parfaitement ennuyeuse</i>,”’ said
Mademoiselle de Rambouillet very dryly.</p>

<p>‘That would serve as an excellent epitome of divers
among our friends,’ murmured Madame de Montausier.</p>

<p>‘Poor Chapelain! all said, he, by merely being
himself, has added infinitely more to our diversion
than the wittiest person in the world,’ said Madame de
Rambouillet, looking mischievously at Mademoiselle
de Scudéry, who, though still wearing the same smile,
was evidently not pleased.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Marquis, when you are made a duke, you would
do well to employ Monsieur Chapelain as your jester.
Ridiculous, solemn people are in reality much more
diverting than wits,’ said Mademoiselle de Rambouillet
to Montausier, who looked extremely displeased, and
said in angry, didactic tones:—</p>

<p>‘Chapelain a des sentiments fins et delicats, il raisonne
juste, et dans ses œuvres on y trouve de nobles et
fortes expressions,’ and getting up he walked over to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
Mademoiselle de Scudéry, and they were soon talking
earnestly together.</p>

<p>Madeleine all this time had been torn between terror
of being introduced to Mademoiselle de Scudéry, and
terror of not being introduced. Her face was absolutely
impassive, and she had ceased to pretend to take any
interest in what was going on around her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard Madame de Rambouillet saying
to Monsieur de Grasse:—</p>

<p>‘You remember Julie’s and her sister’s <i>vision</i> about
night-caps?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes, and the trick played on them by Voiture,
and the poor, excellent Marquis de Pisani.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she answered, with a little sigh and a smile.
‘Well, it has been inherited by little Marie-Julie, whenever
she beholds one she becomes transfixed by terror.
<i>Visions</i> are strange things!’</p>

<p>Madeleine for the first time that afternoon felt happy
and pleased. She herself had always loathed night-caps,
and as a child had screamed with terror whenever
she had seen any one wearing one. What a strange
coincidence that this <i>vision</i> should be shared by Madame
de Rambouillet’s daughters! She turned eagerly to
the Marquis.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur, I hear Madame la Marquise telling how
Mesdames her daughters were wont to be affrighted
by night-caps; when I was a child, they worked on me
in a like manner, and to speak truth, to this day I have
a dislike to them.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, indeed,’ he answered, with his nervous
laugh. ‘Yes, my daughters had quite a <i>vision</i> as to
night-caps. Doubtless ’twas linked in their memory
with some foolish, monstrous fable they had heard
from one of their attendants. ’Tis strange, but our
little granddaughter has inherited the fear and she
refuses to kiss us if we are wearing one.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>Alas! There was no crack through which Madeleine
could get in her own personality! The Marquis got up
and stumbled across the room to Mademoiselle de
Scudéry, and Montausier, having to give up his chair,
sat down by Madeleine. There was a cry of ‘Ah!
here she comes!’</p>

<p>The door opened and a little girl of about seven
years old walked into the room, followed by a <i>gouvernante</i>
who stood respectfully in the doorway. The child
was dressed in a miniature Court dress, cut low and
square at the neck. She had a little pointed face, and
eyes with a slight outward squint. She made a beautiful
curtsey, first to her grandmother and then to the
company.</p>

<p>‘My dearest treasure,’ Madame de Rambouillet cried
in her beautiful husky voice. ‘Come and greet your
friend, Monsieur de Grasse.’</p>

<p>Every one had stopped talking and were looking at
the child with varying degrees of interest. Madeleine
felt suddenly fiercely jealous of her; she stole a glance
at Mademoiselle de Scudéry, and saw on her face the
universal smile of tolerant amusement with which
grown-up people regard children. The child went up
to Godeau, kissed his ring, and then busily and deliberately
found a foot-stool for herself, dragged it up to
Madame de Rambouillet’s bed, and sat down on it.</p>

<p>‘The little lady already has the <i>tabouret chez la reine</i>,’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
said Mademoiselle de Scudéry, smiling and bowing to
Madame de Rambouillet. The child, however, did not
understand the witticism; she looked offended, frowned,
and said severely:—</p>

<p>‘I am working a <i>tabouret</i> for myself,’ and then, as if
to soften what she evidently had meant for a snub,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
she added: ‘It has crimson flowers on it, and a blue
saint feeding birds.’</p>

<p>Montausier went into fits of proud laughter.</p>

<p>‘There is a bit of hagiology for you to interpret,
Monsieur de Grasse,’ he cried triumphantly, suddenly
in quite a good temper, and looking round to see if the
others were amused. Godeau looked interested and
serious.</p>

<p>‘That must be a most rare and delicate <i>tabouret</i>,
Mademoiselle,’ he said; ‘do you know what the saint’s
name is?’</p>

<p>‘No, I thank you,’ she answered politely, but wearily,
and they all again went into peals of laughter.</p>

<p>‘My love,’ said Madame de Rambouillet. ‘I am
certain Monsieur de Grasse and that lady,’ nodding
towards Mademoiselle de Scudéry, ‘would be enchanted
by those delicious verses you wrote for my birthday,
will you recite them?’</p>

<p>But the child shook her head, backwards and forwards,
the more she was entreated, the more energetically
she shook her head, evidently enjoying the process
for its own sake. Then she climbed on to her grandmother’s
bed and whispered something in her ear.
Madame de Rambouillet shook with laughter, and
after they had whispered together for some minutes the
child left the room. Madame de Rambouillet then told
the company that Marie-Julie’s reason for not wishing to
recite her poem was that she had heard her father say
that all <i>hommes de lettres</i> were thieves and were quite
unprincipled about using each other’s writings, and she
was afraid that Mademoiselle de Scudéry or Monsieur
de Grasse might, if they heard her poem, publish it
as their own. There was much laughter, and Montausier
was in ecstasies.</p>

<p>‘I am impatient for you to hear the poem,’ said
Madame de Rambouillet. ‘It is quite delicious.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, my daughter promises to be a second Neuf-germain!’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
said Madame de Montausier, smiling.</p>

<p>‘What a Nemesis, that a mother who has inspired so
many delicious verses, and a father——’ began
Mademoiselle de Scudéry, but just then the child came
back with her head disappearing into a large beplumed
man’s hat, and carrying a shepherd’s crook in her hand.</p>

<p>‘I am a Muse,’ she announced, and the company
exchanged delighted, bewildered glances.</p>

<p>‘Now, I will begin.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, pray do, my dear love,’ said Madame de Rambouillet,
trying to compose her face.</p>

<p>‘The initial letters form my grandmother’s name:
Cathérine,’ she explained, and then, taking her stand
in the middle of the room, began to declaim with great
unction:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Chérie, vous êtes aimable et</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aussi belle que votre perroquet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toujours souriante et douce.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hélas! j’ai piqué mon pouce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">En brodant pour votre jour de fête</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rien qu’une bourse qui n’est pas bête.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">J’aime ma Grandmère, c’est ma chatte,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nellie, mon petit chien, donne lui ta patte,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et lèche la avec ta petite langue.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She then made a little bow to the company, and sat
down again on her <i>tabouret</i>, quite undisturbed by the
enthusiastic applause that had followed her recitation.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle,’ began Godeau solemnly, ‘words fail
me, to use the delicious expression of Saint Amant,
with which to praise your ravishing verses as they
deserve. But if the Abbé Ménage were here, I think he
might ask you if the <i>qui</i> in ... let me see ... the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
sixth line, refers to the <i>bourse</i> or to the act of pricking
your finger. Because if, as I imagine, it is to the latter,
the laws of our language demand the insertion of a <i>ce</i>
before the <i>qui</i>, while the unwritten laws of universal
experience assert that the action of pricking one’s
finger should be called <i>bête</i> not <i>pas bête</i>. We writers
must be prepared for this sort of ignoble criticism.’</p>

<p>‘Of course the <i>qui</i> refers to <i>bourse</i>,’ said Madame de
Montausier, for the child was looking bewildered.
‘You will pardon me but what an exceeding foolish
question from a Member of the Academy! It was
<i>bête</i> to prick one’s finger, but who, with justice, could
call <i>bête</i> a <i>bourse</i> of most quaint and excellent design?
Is it not so, <i>ma chatte</i>?’ The child nodded solemnly,
and Monsieur de Grasse was profuse in his apologies for
his stupidity.</p>

<p>Madeleine had noticed that the only member of the
company, except herself, who had not been entranced
by this performance, was Mademoiselle de Scudéry.
Though she smiled the whole time, and was profuse in
her compliments, yet she was evidently bored. Instead
of pleasing Madeleine, this shocked her, it also made
her rather despise her, for being out of it.</p>

<p>She turned to Montausier and said timidly:—</p>

<p>‘I should dearly love to see Mademoiselle <i>votre fille</i>
and the Cardinal’s baby niece together. They would
make a delicious pair.’ But Montausier either really
did not hear, or pretended not to, and Madeleine had
the horrible embarrassment of speaking to air.</p>

<p>‘Who is that <i>demoiselle</i>?’ the child suddenly cried
in a shrill voice, looking at Madeleine.</p>

<p>‘That is Mademoiselle Hoqueville, my love.’</p>

<p>‘Hoqueville! <i>what</i> a droll name!’ and she went into
peals of shrill laughter. The grandparents and mother
of the child smiled apologetically at Madeleine, but
she, in agony at being humiliated, as she considered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
before Mademoiselle de Scudéry, tried to improve
matters by looking haughty and angry. However, this
remark reminded Madame de Rambouillet of Madeleine’s
existence, and she exclaimed:—</p>

<p>‘Oh! Mademoiselle Hoqueville, you have, as yet,
seen naught of the hôtel. Marie-Julie, my love, go and
say <i>bon-jour</i> to that lady and ask her if she will accompany
you to the <i>salle bleue</i>.’</p>

<p>The child obediently went over to Madeleine, curtseyed,
and held out her hand. Madeleine was not
certain whether she ought to curtsey back or merely
bow without rising from the chair. She compromised
in a cross between the two, which made her feel extremely
foolish. On being asked if she would like to
see <i>la salle bleue</i>, she had to say yes, and followed the
child out of the room.</p>

<p>She followed her through a little <i>cabinet</i>, and then
they were in the famous room, sung by so many poets,
the scene of so many gay and brilliant happenings.</p>

<p>Madeleine’s first feeling was one of intense relief at
being freed from the strain of the bedroom, then, as
it were, she galvanised into activity her demand upon
life, and felt in despair at losing even a few moments
of Mademoiselle de Scudéry’s company. The child
walked on in front humming a little tune to herself.
Madeleine felt she must pull herself together, and make
friends with her.</p>

<p>‘What rare and skilful verses those were you recited
to us,’ she began, her voice harshly breaking the silence
of the huge room. The child looked at her out of her
crab-eyes, pursed up her mouth, and went on humming.</p>

<p>‘Do you dearly love your little dog?’</p>

<p>‘Haven’t got one.’ This was startling.</p>

<p>‘But you made mention of one in your poem,’ said
Madeleine in an aggrieved tone.</p>

<p>The child screamed with scornful laughter:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>‘She isn’t <i>mine</i>, she’s Aunt Angélique’s!’ she cried,
and looked at Madeleine as if she must be mad for
having made such a mistake. There was another pause.
Madeleine sighed wearily and went to look at the
famous tapestry, the child followed her.</p>

<p>Its design consisted of groups of small pastoral
figures disporting themselves in a blue Arcady. In one
group there was a shepherdess sitting on a rustic bench,
surrounded by shepherds; a nymph was offering her a
basket of flowers. The child pointed to the shepherdess:
‘That is my grandmother, and that is me bringing her
flowers, and that is my father, and that is Monsieur
Sarrasin, and that is my dear Maître Claude!’ ...
This was better. Madeleine made a violent effort to be
suitably fantastic.</p>

<p>‘It may be when you are asleep you do in truth
become that nymph and live in the tapestry.’ The child
stared at her, frowned, and continued her catalogue:—</p>

<p>‘And that is my mother, and that is Aunt Angélique,
and that is Madame de Longueville, and that is Madame
de Sablé, and that is Monsieur de la Rochefoucauld,
and that is my little friend Mademoiselle de Sévigné,’
and so on.</p>

<p>When she had been through the list of her acquaintances,
she wandered off and began to play with a box
of ivory puzzles. Madeleine, in a final attempt to
ingratiate herself, found for her some of the missing
pieces, at which her mouth began to tremble, and
Madeleine realised that all the pleasure lay in doing it
by herself, so she left her, and with a heavy heart
crept back to the bedroom.</p>

<p>She found Madame Cornuel and Mademoiselle
Legendre preparing to go, and supposing they had
already said good-bye, solemnly curtseyed to all the
company in turn. They responded with great friendliness
and kindness, but she suddenly noticed Madame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
Cornuel exchanging glances with her step-daughter,
and realised in a flash that by making her <i>adieux</i> she
had been guilty of a provincialism. She smiled grimly
to herself. What did it matter?</p>

<p>Madame Cornuel dropped her in the rue Saint-Honoré,
and she walked quietly home.</p>

<p>She had not exchanged a single word with Mademoiselle
de Scudéry.</p>

</div>

<p>Madeleine walked up the petite rue du Paon, in at
the baker’s door, and upstairs. She still felt numbed,
but knew that before her were the pains of returning
circulation; Madame Troqueville heard her come in and
ran out from the kitchen, full of smiles and questions.
Madeleine told her in a calm voice that it had all been
delightful, praised the agreeable manners of the Rambouillets,
and described the treasures of the <i>salle bleue</i>.
She repeated the quaint sayings of the child, and
Madame Troqueville cried ‘<i>Quel amour!</i> Oh, Madeleine,
I would like you to have just such another little
daughter!’</p>

<p>Madeleine smiled wearily.</p>

<p>‘And what of Mademoiselle de Scu-tary?’ her mother
asked rather nervously.</p>

<p>‘De Scudéry,’ corrected Madeleine, true to habit.
‘She was furiously <i>spirituelle</i> and very ... civil. I
am a trifle tired.... I think I will away and rest,’
and she dragged herself wearily off to her own room.
Madame Troqueville, who had watched her very unhappily,
made as if she would follow her, but thought
better of it.</p>

<p>When Madeleine got into her room, she sat down
on her bed, and clasped her head. She could not, she
would not think. Then, like a wave of ecstasy there
swept over her little points she had noticed about
Mademoiselle de Scudéry, but which had not at the
time thrilled her in the slightest. Her teeth were
rather long; she had a mole on her left cheek; she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
not as grandly dressed as the others; the child had
snubbed her; Montausier had been very attentive to
her; she was a great celebrity; Madame de Rambouillet
had teased her. This medley of recollections, each and
all of them made her feel quite faint with pleasure, so
desirable did they make her love appear. But then ...
she had not spoken to her ... she had been humiliated
before her.... Oh! it was not to be faced! Her
teeth were rather long. Montausier had been attentive to
her ... oh, how thrilling! And yet ... she, Madeleine
had not even been introduced to her. The supernal
powers had seemed to have a scrupulous regard for her
wishes. They had actually arranged that the first
meeting should be at the Hôtel de Rambouillet ...
and she had not even been introduced to her! Could
it be possible that the Virgin had played her a trick?
Should she turn and rend in mad fury the whole
Heavenly Host? No; that would be accepting defeat
once for all, and that must not be, for the past as well
as the future was malleable, and it was only by emotionally
accepting it that a thing became a fact. This
strange undercurrent of thought translated itself thus
in her consciousness: God and the Virgin must be
trusted; they had only disclosed a tiny bit of their
design, what madness then, to turn against them, thus
smashing perhaps their perfect scheme for her happiness!
Or perhaps her own co-operation had not been
adequate—she had perhaps not been instant enough
in dancing—but still ... but still ... the visit to
the Hôtel de Rambouillet was over, she had seen
Mademoiselle de Scudéry, and was still not one inch
nearer to her heart’s desire. She <i>could</i> not face it.</p>

<p>She came down to supper. Her father was silent
and gloomy, shaking his head and twisting his lips.
His visit to <i>his</i> lady had been a failure. Was there
... could there be ... some mystical connection?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
And there was Jacques still limping ... and he had
given her that horrid bead trimming.... <i>No, no, no</i>
... these were insane, goblin ideas that must be crushed.</p>

<p>Her mother was trying hard to be cheerful, and
Jacques kept looking at her anxiously. When supper
was over she went up to her room, half hoping, half
fearing that he would follow.</p>

<p>Shortly there was a scratch at the door (with great
difficulty she had persuaded him to adopt the fashionable
scratch—to knock was <i>bourgeois</i>).</p>

<p>He came in, and gave her a look with his bright eyes,
at once compassionate and whimsical. She felt herself
dully hoping that he would not ask why she was not
wearing the bead trimming. He did not, but began to tell
her of his day, spent mostly at the Palais and a tavern.
But all the time he watched her; she listened languidly.
‘How went the <i>fête galante</i>?’ he asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>‘It was furiously <i>galante</i>,’ she answered with a tragic
smile. He walked slowly up to her, half smiling all the
time, sat down on her bed, and put his arm around her.</p>

<p>‘You are cruelly unhappy, my poor one, I know. But
’twill pass, in time all caprices yield to graver things.’</p>

<p>‘But it is no caprice!’ she cried passionately. ‘Oh,
Jacques, it is hard to make my meaning clear, but
they be real live people with their own pursuits ...
they are all square like little fat boxes ... oh, how
can I make you understand?’</p>

<p>Jacques could not help laughing. ‘I’m sure, ’tis
hateful of them to be like boxes; though, in truth, for
my part, I am to seek ... oh, Madeleine, dear life,
it’s dreadful to be miserable ... the cursed <i>phantasia</i>,
what tricks it plays us ... ’tis a mountebank, don’t
heed it but put your faith in the good old <i>bourgeois</i>
intellect,’ but Madeleine, ignoring this comfort from
Gassendi, moaned out,—</p>

<p>‘Oh! Jacques! I want to die ... you see, ’tis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
this way—they’ve got their own lives and memories,
folded up all tight around them. Oh! can no one ever
get to know any one else?’</p>

<p>He began to understand.</p>

<p>‘Indeed one can, but it takes time. One has to hew
a path through the blood, through the humours, up
to the brain, and, once there, create the Passion of
Admiration. How can it be done at once?’</p>

<p>‘I can’t wait ... I can’t wait ... except things
come at once I’ll have none of them ... at least that’s
not quite my meaning,’ she added hurriedly, looking furtively
round and crossing herself several times. ‘Oh! but
I don’t feel that I am of a humour that can wait....
Oh! I feel something sick and weak in me somewhere.’</p>

<p>‘It’s but those knavish old animal spirits playing
tricks on the will, but I think that it is only because
one is young,’ and he would have launched out on a
philosophical dissertation, only Madeleine felt that she
could not stand it.</p>

<p>‘<i>Don’t</i>, Jacques!’ she screamed. ‘Talk about <i>me</i>, or
I shall go mad!’</p>

<p>‘Well, then, recount to me the whole matter.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! there is nothing worth the telling, but they
<i>would</i> make dædal pleasantries—pleasantries one fails to
understand, except one have a clue—and they would
talk about people with whom I was not acquainted....
Oh! it seems past human compassing to make
friends with a person except one has known them all
one’s life! How <i>could</i> I utter my conceit if they
would converse of matters I did not understand?’ she
repeated furiously. Jacques smiled.</p>

<p>‘I admit,’ he said dryly, ‘to be show man of a troupe
of marionettes is an agreeable profession.’ She looked
at him suspiciously for a second, and then catching his
hands, cried desperately:—</p>

<p>‘Is it beyond our powers ever to make a <i>new</i> friend?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>‘That it is not, but it can’t be effected at once.
I am sure that those <i>Messieurs de Port-Royal</i> would tell
you that even Jesus Christ finds ’tis but a slow business
worming His way into a person’s heart. There He
stands, knocking and knocking, and then——’ Madeleine
saw that he was on the point of becoming profane, and
as her gods did not like profanity, she crossed herself
and cut in with:—</p>

<p>‘But even admitting one can’t come to any degree
of intimacy with a person at once, the <i>beginning</i> of the
intimacy must happen at once, and I’m at a loss to know
how the beginning can happen at once any more than
the whole thing.’</p>

<p>She had got into one of her tight knots of nerves,
when she craved to be reasoned with, if only for the
satisfaction of confounding the reasons offered her.
Jacques clasped his head and laughed.</p>

<p>‘You put me in mind of the philosophy class and old
Zeno! It’s this way, two people meet, nothing takes
place perhaps. They meet again, and one gives a little
look, it may be, that sets the bells of the other’s memory
pleasantly ringing, or says some little thing that tickles
the humours of the other, and thus a current is set up
between them ... a fluid, which gradually reaches
the heart and solidifies into friendship.’</p>

<p>‘But then, there might never be the “little look,”
or the “little word,” and then ... there would be
no friendship’ (she crossed herself) ‘ ... it all seems
at the mercy of Chance.’</p>

<p>‘Of chance ... and of harmony. ’Tis a matter
beyond dispute that we are more in sympathy with
some souls than with others—</p>

<p>‘And do you hold that sympathy can push its
way past ... obstacles ... such as bashfulness, for
example?’</p>

<p>Jacques smiled.</p>

<p>‘In good earnest it can.’ Suddenly her nerves relaxed.</p>

<p>‘Then it is <i>not</i> contrary to natural laws to make a
new friend?’ she cried joyfully.</p>

<p>‘That it is not. And who knows, the rôles may be
reversed ere long and we shall see old Mother Scudéry

<p>Madeleine gave a little sob of joy and flung her
arms round Jacques’s neck. Oh, he was right, he was
right! Had she not herself feared that immediate
success would be <i>bourgeois</i>? ’Twould be breaking every
law of <i>galanterie</i> were Sappho to yield without a struggle.
It took Céladon twelve stout volumes before he won
his Astrée, and, as Jacques had pointed out, Christ
Himself, with all the armaments of Heaven at His
disposal, does not at once break through the ramparts
of a Christian’s heart. But yet ... but yet ... her
relationship with Mademoiselle de Scudéry that afternoon
could not, with the most elastic poetic licence,
be described as that of ‘the nymph that flees, the faun
that pursues!’ Also ... she was not made of stuff
stern enough to endure repeated rebuffs and disappointments.
Already, her nerves were worn to breaking-point.
A one-volumed romance was all her fortitude
could face.... God grant the course of true love
to run smooth from now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>Jacques shortly left her, and she went to bed.</p>

<p>Outside Jacques ran into Madame Troqueville, who
said she wished to speak to him. They went into her
room.</p>

<p>‘Jacques,’ she began, ‘I am uneasy about Madeleine.
I greatly fear things fell not out as she had hoped.
Did she tell you aught of what took place?’</p>

<p>‘I think she is somewhat unhappy because they
didn’t all call her <i>tu</i> right away ... oh, I had forgotten,
she holds it <i>bourgeois</i> to <i>tutoier</i>,’ he answered,
smiling. Madame Troqueville smiled a little too.</p>

<p>‘My poor child, she is of so impatient a humour,
and expects so much,’ and she sighed. ‘Jacques, tell
me about your uncle. Are you of opinion he will make
his way in Paris?’ She looked at him searchingly.
Her eyes were clear and cold like Madeleine’s.</p>

<p>Jacques blushed and frowned; he felt angry with her
for asking him. But her eyes were still fixed on his face.</p>

<p>‘How can I tell, aunt? It hangs on all ... on all
these presidents and people.’</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville gave a little shrug, and her lips
curled into a tiny, bitter smile. ‘I wonder why men
always hold women to be blind, when in reality their
eyes are so exceeding sharp. Jacques, for my sake,
and for Madeleine’s, for the child’s future doth so
depend on it, won’t you endeavour to keep your uncle
from ... from all these places.... I know you take
your pleasure together, and I am of opinion you have
some influence with him.’ Jacques was very embarrassed
and very angry; it was really, he felt, expecting
too much of a young man to try and make him responsible
for his middle-aged uncle.</p>

<p>‘I fear I can do nothing, aunt. ’Tis no business of
mine,’ he said coldly, and they parted for the night.</p>

<span class="smaller">REBUILDING THE HOUSE OF CARDS</span></h3>

</div>

<p>All next day Madeleine had the feeling of something
near her which she must, if she wished to live, push
away, away, right out of her memory. Her vanity
was too vigilant to have allowed her to give to Jacques
a <i>full</i> account of the scene at the Hôtel de Rambouillet.
The fixed smile, the failure to interest the Marquis,
that awful exit, for instance, were too indecent to be
mentioned. Even her thoughts blushed at their
memory, and shuddered away from it—partly, perhaps,
because at the back of her consciousness there dwelt
always the imaginary Sappho, so that to recall these
things was to be humiliated anew in her presence.</p>

<p>In fact, the whole scene at the Hôtel de Rambouillet
must be forgotten, and that quickly, for it had been a
descent into that ruthless world of reality in which
Madeleine could not breathe. That world tyrannised
over by the co-sovereigns Cause and Effect, blown
upon by sharp, rough winds, and—most horrible of
all—fretted with the counter-claims on happiness of
myriads of individuals just as ‘square’ and real as she.
In such a world how could she—with such frightful
odds against her—hope for success, for <i>here</i> she was so
impotent, merely a <i>gauche</i> young girl of no position?</p>

<p>There were times, as I have shown, when she felt a
<i>nostalgie</i> for the world of reality, as a safe fresh place,
but now ... in God’s name, back to her dreams.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Madeleine is entering the door of Sappho’s house.
Sappho is lying on her bed, surrounded by her demoiselles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
(This time Madeleine visualises her quite clearly. She is
swarthy and plain.) When she sees Madeleine, she gives
a little blush, which caresses the motion of Madeleine’s
passions, and fills her with as sweet an expectancy as the
rhythm of a Saraband. Madeleine comes forward, and
kissing her hand says, with the most gallant air in the
world: ‘I am well aware, Madame, that poets are exempt
from the tax to <i>la Dame Vérité</i>, and that they have set
up in her place another Sovereign. So when you gave
me the other day the gracious permission to wait on you,
I had, I admit, a slight fear that you were speaking as
the subject of this sovereign, whose name, I believe, is
<i>le joli Mensonge</i>, and that by taking you at your word,
I would prove myself an eager, ignorant Scythian, unable
to understand what is said, and—more important still—what
is not said, by the citizens of the polite hemisphere.
Madame, I would ten times rather earn such a reputation,
I would ten times rather be an unwelcome visitor, than
to wait another day before I saw you.’ It is a bold speech,
and which, if made by any one else would surely have
aroused all Sappho’s pride and prudishness. At first she
colours and seems slightly confused, and then, she lets a
smile have its own way. She changes the subject, however.</p>

<p>‘Do you consider,’ she asks, ‘that the society of Lesbos
compensates, if I may use the expression, for the enamelled
prairies and melodious brooks of Bœotia? For my own
part, I know few greater pleasures than to sojourn in a
rustic place with my lyre and a few chosen friends.’
These last two words awake the lover’s gadfly, jealousy,
and causes it to give Madeleine a sharp sting.</p>

<p>‘I should imagine, Madame,’ she says coldly, ‘that by
this means you must carry Lesbos with you wherever you
go, and although it is one of the most agreeable spots on
earth, this must deprive you of many of the delights of
travel.’</p>

<p>‘I see that you take me for a provincial of the metropolis,’
says Sappho with a smile full of delicious raillery and in
which Madeleine imagines she detects a realising of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
jealousy and a certain pleasure in it, so that, in spite of
herself, smiling also, she answers,—</p>

<p>‘One has but to read your ravishing verses, which are
as fresh, as full of pomp, and as flowery as a summer
meadow, to know that your pleasure in pastoral joys
is as great as your pleasure in intercourse with <i>les honnêtes
gens</i>, and the other attractions of the town. And this is
combined with such marvellous talent that in your poetry,
the trees offer a pleasanter shade, the flowers a sweeter
odour, the brooks a more soothing lullaby than in earth’s
most agreeable glades.’</p>

<p>‘If you hold,’ answers Sappho smiling, ‘that my verses
make things fairer than they really are, you cannot consider
them really admirable, for surely the closer art resembles
nature the more excellent it becomes.’</p>

<p>‘Pardon me, Madame,’ says Madeleine, also smiling,
‘but we who believe that there are gods and goddesses
ten times fairer than the fairest person on earth, must
also believe that somewhere there exist for these divine
beings habitations ten times fairer than the fairest of
earth’s meadows. And you, Madame, have been carried
to these habitations on the wings of the Muses, and in
your verses you describe the delicious visions you have
there beheld.’</p>

<p>Sappho cannot keep a look of gratification from lighting
up her fine eyes.</p>

<p>‘You think, then, that I have visited the Elysian
Fields?’ she asks.</p>

<p>‘Most certainly,’ rejoins Madeleine quickly. ‘Did I
not call you the other day, in the Palais de Cléomire, the
Sybil of Cumæ?’ She pauses, and draws just the eighth
of an inch closer to Sappho. ‘As such, you are the
authorised guide to the Elysian Fields. May I hope that
some day you will be <i>my</i> conductress there?’</p>

<p>‘Then, as well, I am the “appointed guide” to Avernus,’
says Sappho with a delicious laugh. ‘Will you be willing
to descend there also?’</p>

<p>‘With you as my guide ... yes,’ answers Madeleine.</p>

<p>There follows one of <i>ces beaux silences</i>, more gallant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
than the most agreeable conversation: one of the silences
during which the wings of Cupid can almost be heard
fluttering. Why does the presence of that mignon god,
all dimples and rose-buds, terrify mortals as well as delight
them?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus did Madeleine’s dreams quietly readjust themselves
to their normal state and scornfully tremble
away from reality.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FÊTE-DIEU</span></h3>

</div>

<p>It was the Sunday of the octave of the <i>Fête-Dieu</i>—the
Feast of <i>Corpus Christi.</i> God Himself had walked the
streets like Agamemnon over purple draperies. The
stench of the city had mingled with the perfume of a
thousand lilies—to the Protestant mind, a symbol of
the central doctrine of the day—Transubstantiation.
Transubstantiation beaten out by the cold, throbbing
logic of the Latin hymns of Saint Thomas Aquinas, and
triumphantly confirmed at Bologna by the miraculous
bleeding of the Host.</p>

<p>Seraphic logic and bleeding bread! A conjunction
such as this hints at a secret vice of the cold and immaculate
intellect. What if one came in a dark corner
of one’s dreams upon a celestial spirit feeding upon
carrion?</p>

<p>Past gorgeous altars, past houses still hung with
arras, the Troquevilles walked to Mass. From time to
time they met processions of children apeing the solemn
doings of Thursday, led by tiny, mock priests, shrilly
chanting the office of the day. Other children passed
in the scanty clothing of little Saint John, leading
lambs on pink or blue ribbons. Everything sparkled
in the May sunshine, and the air was full of the scent
of flowers.</p>

<p><i>Et introibo ad altare Dei: ad Deum qui lætificat
juventutem meam</i>—very shortly they would be hearing
these words in Church. They were solemn, sunny words
well suited to the day, but, like the day, to Madeleine
they seemed but a mockery. <i>Ad Deum qui lætificat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
juventutem meam</i>—To God who makes glad my youth!
Where was the kind God of the Semi-Pelagians, and
what joy did <i>she</i> have in her youth?</p>

<p>They walked in silence to their destination—the smug
<i>bourgeois</i> Church Saint-André-des-Arts. Its atmosphere
and furniture did not lend themselves to religious
ecstasy. Among the congregation there was whispering
and tittering and bows of recognition. The gallants
were looking at the belles, and the belles were trying
not to look at the gallants. From marble tombs smirked
many a petrified magistrate, to whose vacuous pomposity
the witty commemorative art of the day had
added by a wise elimination of the third dimension, a
flat, mocking, decorative charm.</p>

<p>Suddenly the frivolity vanished from the atmosphere.
Monsieur Troqueville, who had been alternately yawning
and spitting, pulled himself together and put on what
Jacques called his ‘Mass face’—one of critical solemnity
which seemed to say: ‘Here I am with a completely
unbiassed mind, quite unprejudiced, and a fine judicial
gift for sifting evidence. I am quite willing to believe
that you have the power of turning bread into the
Body and Blood of Christ, but mind! no hocus-pocus,
and not one tiny crumb left untransubstantiated!’</p>

<p>The clergy in the red vestments, symbolic in France
of the Blessed Sacrament, preceded by solemn thurifer,
marched in procession from the sacristy to the altar.
And then began the Sacrifice of High Mass.</p>

<p>The <i>Introit</i> melted into the <i>Kyrie</i>, the <i>Kyrie</i> swelled
into the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i>. The subdeacon sang the
Epistle, the deacon sang the Gospel. The Gospel and
Epistle solidified into the fine rigidity of the Creed.</p>

<p>Madeleine, quite unmoved by the solemn drama, was
examining the creases in the neck of a fat merchant
immediately in front of her. There were three real
creases—the small half ones did not count—and as there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
were three lines in her Litany she might use them as a
sort of Rosary. She felt that she must ‘tell’ the three
creases before he turned his head.</p>

<p>‘Blessed Virgin, Mother of Our Lord, give me the
friendship of Mademoiselle de Scudéry. Guardian
Angel that watchest over me, give me the friendship of
Mademoiselle de Scudéry. Blessed Saint Magdalene,
give me the friendship of Mademoiselle de Scudéry.’</p>

<p>Suddenly ... the sweet, nauseating smell of incense
and the strange music of the Preface—an echo of the
music of Paradise, so said the legend, caught in dreams
by holy apostolic men.</p>

<p><i>Quia per incarnati Verbi mysterium nova inentis
nostræ oculis lux tuæ claritatis infulsit: ut dum visibiliter
Deum cognoscimus per hunc in INVISIBILIUM
AMOREM RAPIAMUR.</i></p>

<p>Dozens of times before had Madeleine heard these
terse Latin words, but to-day, for the first time, she felt
their significance. ‘Caught up to the love of invisible
things’—<i>rapiamur</i>—a ghostly rape—the idea was
beautiful and terrible. Suddenly a great longing swept
over her for the still, significant life of the Spirit, for
the shadowy lining of this bright, hard earth. Yet on
earth itself strange lives had been led ... symbols,
and bitter-sweet sacrifice, and little cells suddenly
filled with the sound of great waters.</p>

<p>A ghostly rape ... she had a sudden vision of the
nervous hands of the Almighty clutching tightly the
yielding flesh of a thick, human body, as in a picture
by the Flemish Rubens she had seen in the Luxembourg.
Surely the body was that of the fat merchant with the
wrinkled neck ... there ... sitting in front of her.
Something is happening ... there are acolytes with
lighted tapers ... a bell is ringing ... the central
Mystery is being consummated. For one strange,
poignant second Madeleine felt herself in a world of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
non-bulk and non-colour. She buried her face in her
hands and, though her mind formed no articulate prayer,
she worshipped the Unseen. Her mundane desires had,
for the moment, dropped from her and their place
was taken by her old ambition of one day being able
to go up to the altar, strong in grace, a true penitent,
to partake of the inestimable blessing of the Eucharist.</p>

<span class="smaller">ROBERT PILOU’S SCREEN</span></h3>

</div>

<p>When Mass was over, Madeleine walked home with
her parents in absolute silence. She was terribly afraid
of losing the flavour of her recent experience. She
specially dreaded Jacques. He was such a scoffer;
besides, at this moment, she felt a great distaste for the
insincerity of her relationship with him. However, as
it happened, he did not come in to dinner that day.</p>

<p>After dinner she went to her room and lay down
on her bed, in the hopes of sleeping, and so guarding her
religious emotion from the contamination of thoughts
and desires—for, at the bottom of her heart, she knew
quite well that her obsession was only dozing. Finally,
she did fall asleep, and slept for some hours.</p>

<p>When she awoke, it was half-past four, and she
realised with joy that she had nursed successfully the
mystic atmosphere. She felt a need for space and
fresh air, and hastily put on her pattens, mask, and
cloak. As she came out of her room, her mother
appeared from the parlour.</p>

<p>‘Madeleine—dear life—whither in the name of
madness, are you bound? You cannot be contemplating
walking alone? Why, ’twill soon be dusk! Jacques
should shortly return, and he’ll accompany you!’</p>

<p>This was unbearable. In a perfect frenzy, lest the
spell should be broken, Madeleine gathered up her
petticoats and made a dash for the staircase.</p>

<p>‘Madeleine! Madeleine! Is the child demented?
Come back! I command you!’</p>

<p>‘For God’s sake, <i>let me be</i>!’ screeched Madeleine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
furiously from half-way down the stairs. ‘Curse her!
With her shrill importunity she has shattered the
serenity of my humour!’ she muttered to herself, in
the last stage of nervous irritation.</p>

<p>She had half a mind to go back and spend the rest
of the afternoon in dinning into her mother that by
her untimely interruption she had arrested a <i>coup de
Grâce</i>, and come between her and her ultimate redemption.
But pleasant though this would be, the soft
sunshine of early June was more so, so she ran down
the stairs and into the street.</p>

<p>At first she felt so irritated and ruffled that she
feared the spell was broken for ever, but gradually it
was renewed under the magical idleness of the Sunday
afternoon. In a house opposite some one was playing a
Saraband on the lute. From a neighbouring street came
the voices and laughter of children—otherwise the whole
neighbourhood seemed deserted.</p>

<p>Down the long rue des Augustins, that narrowed to
a bright point towards the Seine, she wandered with
wide, staring eyes, to meet something, she knew not
what. Then up the quays she wandered, up and on,
still in a trance.</p>

<p>Finally she took her stand on the Pont-Rouge, a
little wooden bridge long since replaced. For some
moments she gazed at the Seine urbanely flowing
between the temperate tints of its banks, and flanked
on its right by the long, gray gallery of the Louvre.
Everything was shrouded in a delicate distance-lending
haze; there was the Cité—miles and miles away it seemed—nuzzling
into the water and dominated by the twin
towers of Notre-Dame. They had caught the sun, and
though unsubstantial, they still looked sturdy—like
solid cubes of light. The uniform gray-greenness of
everything—Seine and Louvre and Cité—and a quality
in it all of decorative unreality, reminded Madeleine of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
a great, flat, gray-green picture by Mantegna of the
death of Saint Sebastian, that she had seen in one of
the Palaces.</p>

<p>The bell of Saint-Germain-des-Prés began to peal
for Vespers. She started murmuring to herself the
Vesper hymn—<i>Lucis Creator</i>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Ne mens gravata crimine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vitæ sit exul munere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dum nil perenne cogitat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seseque culpis illigat.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘Grant that the mind, borne down by the charge of
guilt, be not an exile from the fulfilment of life, perennially
pondering emptiness and binding itself by its
transgressions.’</p>

<p>Yes, that was a prayer she had need of praying.
‘An exile from the fulfilment of life’—that was what
she had always feared to be. An exile in the provinces,
far from the full stream of life—but what was Paris
itself but a backwater, compared with the City of
God? ‘Perennially pondering emptiness’—yes, that
was her soul’s only exercise. She had long ceased to
ponder grave and pregnant matters. The time had come
to review once more her attitude to God and man.</p>

<p>She had come lately to look upon God as a Being
with little sense of sin, who had a mild partiality for
<i>attrition</i> in His creatures, but who never demanded
<i>contrition</i>. And the compact into which she had entered
with Him was this: she was to offer Him a little lip-service,
perform daily some domestic duties and pretend
to Jacques she was in love with him; in return for
this He (aided by her dances) was to procure for her
the entrée into the inner circle of the Précieuses, and
the friendship of Mademoiselle de Scudéry! And the
tenets of Jansenism—it was a long time since she had
boldly faced them. What were they?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>Every man is a tainted creature, fallen into an incurable
and permanent habit of sinning. His every
action, his every thought—beginning from the puny
egotism of his babyhood—is a loathsome sin in the eyes
of God. The only remedy for the diseased will that
prompts these sinful thoughts and actions is the
sovereign, infallible grace that God sends on those
whom He has decided in His secret councils to raise
to a state of triumphant purity. And what does this
Grace engender? An agony of repentance, a loathing
of things visible, and a burning longing for things
invisible—<i>in invisibilium amorem rapiamur</i>, yes, that is
the sublime and frigid fate of the true penitent.</p>

<p>And she had actually deceived herself so far as to
think that the Arch-Enemy of sin manifested His goodness
like a weak, earthly father by gratifying one’s
worldly desires, one’s ‘concupiscence’ which Jansenius
calls the ‘source of all the other vices’! No, His gifts
to men were not these vain baubles, the heart’s desires,
but Grace, the Eucharist, His perpetual Presence on
the Altar—gigantic, austere benefits befitting this
solemn abstract universe, in which angels are helping
men in the fight for their immortal souls.</p>

<p>Yes, this was the Catholic faith, this was the true
and living God, to Whose throne she had dared to
come with trivial requests and paltry bargainings.</p>

<p>She felt this evening an almost physical craving for
perfect sincerity with herself, so without flinching she
turned her scrutiny upon her love for Mademoiselle
de Scudéry. There flashed into her mind the words
of Jansenius upon the sin of Adam:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘What could Adam love after God, away from whom
he had fallen? What could so sublime a spirit love but
the sublimest thing after God Himself, namely—<i>his own</i>
spirit?... This love, through which he wished, somehow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
to take joy in himself, in as much as he could no
longer take joy in God, in itself did not long suffice. Soon
he apprehended its indigence, and that in it he would
never find happiness.</p>

<p>‘Then, seeing that the way was barred that led back
to God, the source of true felicity from which he had cut
himself off, the want left in his nature precipitated
him towards the creatures here below, and he wandered
among them, hoping that <i>they</i> might satisfy the want.
Thence come those bubbling desires, whose name is legion;
those tight, cruel chains with which he is bound by the
creatures he loves, that bondage, not only of himself
but of all he imprisons by their love for him. Because,
once again, in this love of his for all other things, it is
above all <i>himself</i> that he holds dear. In all his frequent
delights it is always—and this is a remnant of his ancient
noble state—in <i>himself</i> that he professes to delight.’</p>

</div>

<p>How could she, knowing this passage, have deceived
herself into imagining she could save her soul by love
for a creature?</p>

<p>The words of Jansenius were confirmed by those of
Saint Augustine:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I lived in adultery away from Thee.... For the
friendship of this world is adultery against Thee,’</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and her own conscience confirmed them both, for it
whispered that her obsession for Mademoiselle de
Scudéry was nothing but a subtle development of her
<i>amour-propre</i>, and what was more, had swollen to such
dimensions as completely to blot out God from her
universe.</p>

<p>Well, she stood condemned in all her desires and in
all her activities!</p>

<p>What was to be done? With regard to one matter
at least her duty was clear. She must confess to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
Jacques that she had lied to him when she said she
loved him.</p>

<p>And Mademoiselle de Scudéry ... would she be
called upon to chase her from her heart? Oh, the
cruelty of it! The horse-face and the plain gray gown
... the wonderful invention in <i>galanterie</i> made by herself
and the Grecian Sappho ... the delicious ‘light fire’
of expectancy ... the desirability of being loved in
return ... the deep, deep roots it had taken in her
heart. To see the figure in gray serge growing smaller
and smaller as earth receded from her, and as her new
<i>amours</i>—the ‘invisible things’—drew her up, and up
with chill, shadowy arms—<i>she couldn’t, she couldn’t</i>
face it!</p>

<p>In mental agony she leaned her elbows on the parapet
of the bridge, and pressing her fingers against her eyes,
she prayed passionately for guidance.</p>

<p>When she opened them, two gallants were passing.</p>

<p>‘Have you heard the <i>mot</i> Ninon made to the Queen
of Sweden?’ one was asking.</p>

<p>‘No, what was it?’</p>

<p>‘Her Majesty asked her for a definition of the
Précieuses, and Ninon said at once, “<i>Madame, les Précieuses
sont les Jansénistes de l’amour!</i>” ’Twas
prettily said, wasn’t it?’ They laughed, and were
soon out of sight.</p>

<p>‘Les Précieuses sont les Jansénistes de l’amour!’
Madeleine laughed aloud, as there swept over her a
flood of what she imagined to be divine illumination.
Her prayer for guidance had been miraculously answered,
and in a manner perfectly accordant with her own
wishes. It was obviously a case of Robert Pilou’s sacred
screen. ‘Profane history told by means of sacred prints
becomes sacred history.’ A Précieuse need only have a
knack of sacramentalism to become in the same way
a Jansenist, for there was a striking resemblance between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
the two creeds. In their demands on their followers they
had the same superb disregard for human weakness,
and in both this disregard was coupled with a firm
belief in original sin (for the contempt and loathing with
which the Précieuses regarded the manners of all those
ignorant of their code sprang surely from a belief in
‘original boorishness’ which in their eyes was indistinguishable
from ‘original sin’), the only cure for which
was their own particular form of grace. And the
grace of the Précieuses, namely, <i>l’air galant</i>—that elusive
social quality which through six or seven pages of <i>Le
Grand Cyrus</i>, gracefully evades the definitions in which
the agile authoress is striving to hold it, that quality
without which the wittiest conversation is savourless,
the most graceful compliment without fragrance, that
quality which can be acquired by no amount of good-will
or application, and which can be found in the
muddiest poet and be lacking in the most elegant
courtier—did it not offer the closest parallel to the
mysterious grace of the Jansenists without which there
was no salvation, and which was sometimes given in
abundance to the greatest sinners and denied to the
most virtuous citizens? And then—most striking
analogy of all—the Précieuses’ conception of the true
lover possessed just those qualities demanded from us
by Saint Paul and the Jansenists. What finer symbol,
for instance, of the perfect Christian could be found
than that of the hero of the <i>Astrée</i>, Céladon, the perfect
lover?</p>

<p>Yes, in spite of Saint Augustine’s condemnation of
the men ‘who blushed for a solecism,’ she could sanctify
her preciosity by making it the symbol of her spiritual
development, and—oh, rapture—she could sanctify
her obsession for Mademoiselle de Scudéry by making
it definitely the symbol of her love for Christ, not merely
a means of curing her <i>amour-propre</i>. Through <i>her</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
she would learn to know Him. Had it not been said by
Saint Augustine: ‘<i>My sin was just this, that I sought
for pleasure, grandeur, vanity, not in Him, but in His
creatures</i>,’ by which he surely meant that the love of the
creature for the creature was not in <i>itself</i> a sin, it only
became so when it led to forgetting the Creator.</p>

<p>So, with singular rapidity this time, ‘La folie de la
Croix s’est atténuée.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was already twilight. In the Churches they would
be celebrating Compline. The choir would be singing:
‘<i>Jube, Domine, benedicere</i>,’ and the priest would answer:
‘<i>Noctem quietam et finem perfectum concedat nobis
Dominus omnipotens</i>.’</p>

<p>The criers of wafers were beginning their nocturnal
song: ‘<i>La joie! la joie! Voilà des oublies!</i>’ It
was time to go home; her mother would be anxious;
she must try very hard not to be so inconsiderate.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when she reached the petite rue
du Paon. She found Madame Troqueville almost frantic
with anxiety, so she flung her arms round her neck
and whispered her contrition for her present lateness
and her former ill-humour. Madame Troqueville pressed
her convulsively and whispered back that she was never
ill-humoured, and even if she were, it was no matter.
In the middle of this scene in came Berthe, nodding
and becking. ‘Ah! Mademoiselle is <i>câline</i> in her
ways! She is skilled in wheedling her parents—a
second Nausicaa!’</p>

<span class="smaller">A DEMONSTRATION IN FAITH</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The scruples with regard to having compromised with an
uncompromising God which Madeleine entertained in
spite of herself were silenced by the determination of
settling things with Jacques. For a right action is a
greater salve to conscience than a thousand good
resolutions.</p>

<p>This determination gave her a double satisfaction,
for she had realised that the relationship was also a
sin against preciosity—and a very deadly sin to boot.
For one thing, <i>les honnêtes femmes</i> must never love
more than once, and then her shameful avowal that
‘<i>she loved him very much, and that he might take his fill
of kissing</i>,’ would surely cause the belles who staked their
reputation on never permitting a gallant to succeed in
expressing his sentiments and who were beginning to
shudder at even the ‘minor favours,’ such as the
acceptance of presents and the discreetest signs of the
chastest complacency, to fall into a swoon seven
fathoms deep of indignation, horror, and scorn.</p>

<p>The retraction should be made that very evening,
she decided; it was to be her Bethel, a spiritual stone
set up as a covenant between herself and God. But
Jacques did not come back to supper that evening,
so it happened that she celebrated her new <i>coup de
grâce</i> in a vastly more agreeable manner.</p>

<p>After supper she had gone into her own room and
had begun idly to turn over the pages of <i>Cyrus</i>, and, as
always happened, it soon awoke in her an agonising
sense of the author’s charms, and a craving for closer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
communion with her than was afforded by the perusal
of even these intimate pages. This closer communion
could only be reached through a dance. In a second
she was up and leaping:—</p>

<p><i>She has gone to a ‘Samedi’ where she finds a select
circle of Sappho’s friends</i> ... then by a great effort
of will she checks herself. Is she a Jansenist or is she
not? And if she <i>is</i> a Jansenist, is this dancing reconcilable
with her tenets? As a means of moulding the
future it certainly is not, for the future has been decided
once and for all in God’s inscrutable councils. As a
mere recreation, it is probably harmless. But is there
no way of making it an integral part of her religious
life? Yes, from the standpoint of Semi-Pelagianism it
was a means of helping God to make the future, from
the standpoint of Jansenism it can be <i>a demonstration
in faith</i>, by which she tells God how safe her future is
in His hands, and how certain she is of His goodness
and mercy in the making of it.</p>

<p>Then, an extra sanctity can be given to its contents
by the useful device of Robert Pilou’s screen—let
the talk be as witty and gallant as you please,
as long as every conceit has a mystical second
meaning.</p>

<p>This settled, once more she started her dance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Madeleine has gone to a ‘Samedi’ at Mademoiselle
de Scudéry’s, where she finds a select circle of Sappho’s
friends.</i></p>

<p><i>The talk drifts to the writings of ‘Callicrate,’ as the
late Monsieur Voiture was called.</i></p>

<p><i>‘There is a certain verse of his from which an astute
reader can deduce that he was not a Jansenist,’ says
Madeleine, with a deliciously roguish smile. ‘Can any
of the company quote this verse?’</i></p>

<p><i>A wave of amused interest passes over the room.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p><i>‘I did not know that Callicrate was a theologian,’ says
Sappho.</i></p>

<p><i>‘A theologian, yes, for he was an admirable professor of
love’s theory, but a real Christian, no, for he was but a
feeble and faithless lover,’ answers Madeleine, looking
straight into Sappho’s eyes. Sappho colours, and with
a laugh which thrills Madeleine’s ear, with a tiny note
of nervousness says</i>:—</p>

<p><i>‘Well, Mademoiselle, prove your theory about Callicrate
by quoting the verses you allude to, and if you cannot
do so, we will exact a forfeit from you for being guilty of
the crime of having aroused the delightful emotion of
curiosity without the justification of being able to gratify
it.’ The company turn their smiling eyes on Madeleine,
who proceeds to quote the following lines</i>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Ne laissez rien en vous capable de déplaire.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Faites-vous toute belle: et <i>tachez de parfaire</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>L’ouvrage que les Dieux ont si fort avancé</i>:’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>‘Now these lines allow great power to <span class="antiqua">le libre arbitre</span>,
and suppose a collaboration between the gods and mortals
in the matter of the soul’s redemption, which would, I
am sure, bring a frown to the brows of <span class="antiqua">les Messieurs de
Port-Royale</span>.’</i></p>

<p><i>‘Sappho, I think it is we that must pay forfeits to
Mademoiselle, not she to us, for she has vindicated herself
in the most <span class="antiqua">spirituel</span> manner in the world,’ says Cléodamas.</i></p>

<p><i>‘Let her lay a task on each of us that must be performed
within five minutes,’ suggests Philoxène.</i></p>

<p><i>‘Mademoiselle, what labours of Hercules are you going
to impose on us?’ asks Sappho, smiling at Madeleine.
Madeleine thinks for a moment and then says</i>:—</p>

<p><i>‘Each of you must compose a <span class="antiqua">Proposition Galante</span> on
the model of one of the Five.’</i></p>

<p><i>The company is delighted with the idea, and Théodamas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
writes out the five original Propositions that the company
may have their models before them, and proceeds to read
them out</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) <i>Some of God’s commandments it is impossible
for the Just to obey owing to the present state of their
powers, in spite of the desire of doing so, and in spite of
great efforts: and the Grace by which they might obey
these commandments is lacking.</i></p>

<p>(2) <i>That in the state of fallen nature, one never resists
the interior grace.</i></p>

<p>(3) <i>That to merit and demerit in the state of fallen
nature, it is not necessary that man should have liberty
opposed to necessity (to will), but that it suffices that he
should have liberty opposed to constraint.</i></p>

<p>(4) <i>That the Semi-Pelagians admitted the necessity
of the inward grace preceding every action, even the
inception of Faith, but that they were heretics in so far
as they held that grace to be of such a nature that the
will of man could either resist it or obey it.</i></p>

<p>(5) <i>That it is a Semi-Pelagian error to say that the
Founder of our faith died and shed His blood universally,
for all men.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>They all take out their tablets and begin to write. At
the end of five minutes Madeleine tells them to stop.</i></p>

<p><i>‘I have taken the first as my model,’ says Sappho,
‘and indeed I have altered it only very slightly.’ The
company begs to hear it.</i></p>

<p><i>‘No commandment of a lady is too difficult for an
<span class="antiqua">homme galant</span> to obey, for to him every lady is full of
grace, and this grace inspires him with powers more
than human.’</i></p>

<p><i>Every one applauds, and expresses their appreciation
of her wit.</i></p>

<p><i>‘And now,’ says Madeleine, ‘that our appetite has been
so deliciously whetted—if I may use the expression—by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
Sappho, have the rest of the company got their <span class="antiqua">ragoûts</span>
ready?</i>’</p>

<p><i>Doralise looks at Théodamas, and Théodamas at
Philoxène, and they laugh.</i></p>

<p><i>‘Mademoiselle, blindness is the penalty for looking on
a goddess, and dumbness, I suppose, that of listening to
two Muses. We are unable to pay our forfeits,’ says
Théodamas, with a rueful smile.</i></p>

<p><i>‘Will not Mademoiselle rescue the Sorbonne <span class="antiqua">galante</span>
from ignominy, and herself supply the missing propositions?’
says Sappho, throwing at Madeleine a glance,
at once arch and challenging.</i></p>

<p><i>‘Yes! Yes!’ cries the company, ‘let the learned
doctor herself compile the theology of Cupid!’</i></p>

<p><i>‘When Sappho commands, even the doctors of the Sorbonne
obey,’ says Madeleine gallantly. ‘Well, then, I
will go on to the second proposition in which I will change
nothing but <span class="antiqua">one</span> word. “That in the state of fallen nature,
man never resists the <span class="antiqua">external</span> grace.”’ The company
laughs delightedly.</i></p>

<p><i>‘By the third I must admit to be vanquished,’ she
continues, ‘the fourth is not unlike that of Sappho’s!
“That courtiers, although they admit the necessity of
feminine grace preceding every movement of their passions,
are heretics in so far that they hold the wishes of ladies to
be of such a nature that the will of man can either, as it
chooses, resist or obey them.”’</i></p>

<p><i>‘Delicious!’ cries the company, ‘that is furiously well
expressed, and a well-merited condemnation of Condé
and his petits-maîtres.’</i></p>

<p><i>‘And now we come to the fifth, which calls for as much
pruning as one of the famous Port-Royal pear-trees.
“That it is an error of provincials and other barbarians
to say that lovers burn with a universal flame, or that
<span class="antiqua">les honnêtes femmes</span> give their favours to <span class="antiqua">all</span> men.”’
Loud applause follows.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p><i>‘Mademoiselle,’ says Théodamas, ‘you have converted
me to Jansenism.’</i></p>

<p><i>‘Such a distinguished convert as the great Théodamas
will certainly compensate the sect for all the bulls launched
against it by the Holy Father,’ says Madeleine gallantly.</i></p>

<p><i>‘Well, I must admit that by one thing the Jansenists
have certainly added to <span class="antiqua">la douceur de la vie</span>, and that is
by what we may call their Miracle of the Graces,’ says Sappho.</i></p>

<p><i>‘What does Madame mean by “the Miracle of the
Graces”?’ asks Madeleine, smiling.</i></p>

<p><i>‘I mean the multiplication of what till their day had
been <span class="antiqua">three</span> Graces into <span class="antiqua">at least</span> four times that number.
To have done so deserves, I think, to be called a miracle.’</i></p>

<p><i>‘The most miraculous—if I may use the expression—of
the miracles recorded in the Lives of the Saints has
always seemed to me the Miracle of the Beautiful City,’
says Madeleine innocently.</i></p>

<p><i>‘What miracle is that? My memory fails me, if I
may use the expression,’ says Sappho, in a puzzled
voice.</i></p>

<p><i>‘Madame, I scarcely believe that a lady so widely and
exquisitely informed as Sappho of Lesbos in both what
pertains to mortals and in what pertains to gods, in short
in Homer and in Hesiod, should never have heard of the
“Miracle of the Beautiful City,”’ says Madeleine, in
mock surprise.</i></p>

<p><i>‘Then Mademoiselle—as you say you can scarcely
believe it—you show yourself to be a lady of but little
faith!’ says Sappho, her eye lighted by a delicious gleam
of raillery.</i></p>

<p><i>‘I must confess that the miracle Mademoiselle mentions
has—if I may use the expression—escaped <span class="antiqua">my</span> memory
too,’ says Théodamas.</i></p>

<p><i>‘And ours,’ say Doralise and Philoxène.</i></p>

<p><i>‘So <span class="antiqua">this</span> company of all companies has never heard of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
the Miracle of the Beautiful City!’ cries Madeleine.
‘Well, I will recount it to you.</i></p>

<p><i>‘Once upon a time, in a far barbarian country, there
lived a great saint. Everything about her was a miracle—her
eyes, her hands, her figure, and her wit. One night
an angel appeared to her and said: (I will not yet tell
you the saint’s name), “Take your lyre” (I forgot to
mention that the saint’s performance on this instrument
was also a miracle, and a furiously agreeable one), “Take
your lyre, and go and play upon it in the wilderness.”
And the saint obeyed the angel’s command, though the
wilderness was filled with lions and tigers and every other
ferocious beast. But when the saint began to play they
turned into ... doves and linnets.’ A tiny smile of
comprehension begins to play round the eyes of the company.
Madeleine goes on, quite gravely</i>:—</p>

<p><i>‘But that was only a baby miracle beside that which
followed. As the saint played, out of the earth began to
spring golden palaces, surrounded by delicious gardens,
towers of porphyry, magnificent temples, in short, all
the agreeable monuments that go to the making of a great
city, and of which, as a rule, Time is the only building
contractor. But, in a few minutes, this great Saint built
it merely by playing on her lyre. Madame, the city’s
name was Pretty Wit, and the Saint’s name was ...
can the company tell me?’ and she looks roguishly round.</i></p>

<p><i>‘It is a name of five letters, and its first letter is S
and its last O,’ says Théodamas, with a smile.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Madeleine flung herself breathless and exhausted on
her bed.</p>

<p>Deep down her conscience was wondering if she had
achieved a genuine reconciliation between Preciosity
and Jansenism.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="smaller">MOLOCH</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The period that ensued was one of great happiness
for Madeleine. It was spent in floating on her own
interpretation of the Jansenists’ ‘full sea of grace,’
happy in the certainty, secure in the faith, that God
in His own good time would grant her desires, and
reverse the rôles of fugitive and pursuer. And being
set free from the necessity of making her own future,
<i>ipso facto</i> she was also released from the importunities
of the gnat-like taboos and duties upon the doing or
not doing of which had seemed to depend her future
success.</p>

<p>She felt at peace with God and with man, and her
family found her unusually gentle, calm, and sympathetic.</p>

<p>But Bethel was not yet raised. This was partly due
to the inevitable torpor caused by an excess of faith.
If it was God’s will that she should have an explanation
with Jacques, He would furnish the occasion and the
words.</p>

<p>So the evenings slipped by, and Madeleine continued
to receive Jacques’s caresses with an automatic
responsiveness.</p>

<p>Then, at a party at the Troguins, she met a benevolent
though gouty old gentleman, in a black taffeta jerkin
and black velvet breeches, and he was none other than
Monsieur Conrart, perpetual secretary to the Academy,
and self-constituted master of the ceremonies at the
‘<i>Samedis</i>’ of Mademoiselle de Scudéry. Madeleine
was introduced to him, and her demure attention to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
his discourse, her modest demeanour, and her discreet
feminine intelligence pleased him extremely. She
made no conscious effort to attract him, she just trusted
God, and, to ring another change on her favourite <i>quolibet</i>,
it was as if <i>la Grâce</i> confided to the Graces the
secret of its own silent, automatic action. He grew
very paternal, patted her on the knee with his fat,
gouty hand, and focused his energies on the improvement
of <i>her</i> mind instead of the collective mind of
the company.</p>

<p>The end of it was that he promised to take her with
him to the very next ‘<i>Samedi</i>.’</p>

<p>On the way home, she and Jacques went for a stroll
in the Place Maubert, that favourite haunt of <i>petits-bourgeois</i>,
where in pathetic finery they aired their puny
pretensions to pass for <i>honnêtes gens</i>, or, more happily
constituted, exercised their capacity for loud laughter
and coarse wit, and the one privilege of their class,
that of making love in public.</p>

<p>As a rule, Madeleine would rather have died than
have been seen walking in the Place Maubert, but now,
when her soul was floating on a sea of grace, so dazzlingly
sunny, it mattered but little in which of the paths of
earth her body chose to stray; however, this evening,
her happiness was a little disturbed by an inward
voice telling her that now was the time for enlightening
Jacques with regard to her feelings towards
him.</p>

<p>She looked at him; he was a lovable creature and
she realised that she would sorely miss him. Then she
remembered that on Saturday she was going to see
Sappho, and in comparison with her the charm of pale,
chestnut-haired young men lost all potency. She was
going to see Sappho. God was very good!</p>

<p>They were threading their way between squares of
box clipped in arabesque. It was sunset, and from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
distant shrubbery there came the sounds of children
at their play. The pungent smell of box, the voices
of children playing at sunset; they brought to Madeleine
a sudden whiff of the long, nameless nostalgia of childhood,
a nostalgia for what? Perhaps for the <i>vitæ
munus</i> (the fulfilment of life) of the Vesper hymn;
well, on Saturday she would know the <i>vitæ munus</i>.</p>

<p>She seized Jacques’s arm and, with shining eyes,
cried out: ‘Oh, God is exceeding merciful to His chosen!
He keeps the promise in the Psalms, He “maketh glad
our youth.” When I think on His great goodness ...
I want ... I want ... Oh, words fail me! How
comes it, Jacques, you do not see His footsteps everywhere
upon the earth?’ She was trembling with
exultation and her voice shook.</p>

<p>Jacques looked at her gently, and his face was
troubled.</p>

<p>‘One cannot reveal Grace to another by words and
argument,’ she went on, ‘each must <i>feel</i> it in his own
soul, but let it once be felt, then never more will one be
obnoxious to doubts on ghostly matters, willy-nilly
one will believe to all eternity!’</p>

<p>They found a quiet little seat beside a fountain and
sat down. After a moment’s silence Madeleine once
more took up her <i>Te Deum</i>.</p>

<p>‘Matter for thanksgiving is never wanting, as inch
by inch the veil is lifted from the eyes of one’s spirit to
discover in time the whole fair prospect of God’s most
amiable Providence. Oh, Jacques, <i>why</i> are you blind?’
His only answer was to kick the pebbles, his eyes fixed
on the ground.</p>

<p>Then, in rather a constrained voice, he said: ‘I
would rather put it thus; matter for <i>pain</i> is never
wanting to him who stares at the world with an honest
and unblinking eye. What sees he? Pain—pain—and
again pain. It is harsh and incredible to suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
’twould be countenanced by a <i>good</i> God. What say
you, Chop, to pain?’</p>

<p>Madeleine was pat with her answers from Jansenism—the
perfection of man’s estate before the Fall, when
there was granted him the culminating grace of free
will, his misuse of it by his choice of sin, and its
attendant, pain.</p>

<p>Jacques was silent for a moment, and then he said:—</p>

<p>‘I can conceive of no scale of virtues wherein room is
found for a lasting, durable, and unremitted anger,
venting itself on the progeny of its enemy unto the
tenth and twentieth-thousand generation. Yet, such
an anger was cherished by your God, towards the
children of Adam. Nor in any scale of virtues is there
place for the pregnant fancy of an artificer, who having
for his diversion moulded a puppet out of mud, to show,
forsooth, the cunning of his hand, makes that same
puppet sensible to pain and to affliction. Why, ’tis
a subtle malice of which even the sponsors of Pandora
were guiltless! Then his ignoble chicanery! With
truly kingly magnanimity he cedes to the puppet the
franchise of free will; but mark what follows! The
puppet, guileless and trusting, proceeds to enjoy its
freedom, when lo! down on its head descends the
thunder-bolt, that it may know free will must not be
exercised except in such manner as is accordant with the
purposes of the giver. The pettifogging attorney!</p>

<p>‘Yes, your God is bloodier than Moloch, more perfectly
tyrant than Jove, more crafty and dishonest
than Mercury.</p>

<p>‘Have you read the fourth book of Virgil’s <i>Æneid</i>?
In it I read a tragedy more pungent than the cozenage
of Dido—that of a race of mortals, quick in their apprehensions,
tender in their affections, sensible to the
dictates of conscience and of duty, who are governed
by gods, ferocious and malign, as far beneath them in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
the scale of creation as are the roaring lions of the
Libyan desert. And were I not possessed by the
certainty that your faith is but a monstrous fiction,
my wits would long ere now have left me in comparing
the rare properties of good men with those of your
low Hebrew idol.’</p>

<p>Madeleine looked at him curiously. This was surely
a piece of prepared rhetoric, not a spontaneous outburst.
So she was not the only person who in her imagination
spouted eloquence to an admiring audience!</p>

<p>Although she had no arguments with which to meet
his indictment, her faith, not a whit disturbed, continued
comfortably purring in her heart. But as she
did not wish to snub his outburst by silence—her mood
was too benevolent—she said:—</p>

<p>‘Do you hold, then, that there is no good power
behind the little accidents of life?’</p>

<p>‘The only good power lies in us ourselves, ’tis the
Will that Descartes writes of—a magic sword like to
the ones in <i>Amadis</i>, a delicate, sure weapon, not rusting
in the armoury of a tyrannical god, but ready to the
hand of every one of us to wield it when we choose.
<i>Les hommes de volonté</i>—they form the true <i>noblesse
d’épée</i>, and can snap their fingers at Hozier and his
heraldries,’ he paused, then said very gently, ‘Chop,
I sometimes fear that in your wild chase after winged
horses you may be cozened out of graver and more
enduring blessings, which, though they be not as rare
and pretty as chimeras....’</p>

<p>‘Because you choose to stick on them the name of
chimeras,’ Madeleine interrupted with some heat, ‘it
does not a whit alter their true nature. Though your
mind may be too narrow to stable a winged horse, that
is no hindrance to its finding free pasturage in the
mind of God, of which the universe is the expression.
And even if they should be empty cheats—which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
are <i>not</i>—do you not hold the Duc de Liancourt was
worthy of praise in that by a cunningly painted perspective
he has given the aspect of a noble park watered
by a fair river to his narrow garden in the Rue de
Seine?’</p>

<p>‘Why, if we be on the subject of painted perspectives,’
said Jacques, ‘it is reported that the late cardinal
in his villa at Rueil had painted on a wall at the end of
his <i>Citronière</i> the Arch of Constantine. ’Twas a life-size
cheat and so cunning an imitation of nature was
shown in the painting of sky and hills between the
arches, that foolish birds, thinking to fly through have
dashed themselves against the wall. Chop, it would
vex me sorely to see you one of these birds!’</p>

<p>A frightened shadow came into Madeleine’s eyes,
and she furtively crossed herself. Then, once more,
she smiled serenely.</p>

<p>For several moments they were silent, and then
Jacques said hesitatingly:—</p>

<p>‘Dear little Chop ... I would have you deal quite
frankly with me, and tell me if you mean it when you
say you love me. There are moments when a doubt
... I <i>must</i> know the truth, Chop!’</p>

<p>In an almost miraculous manner the way had been
made easy for her confession, and ... she put her
arms round his neck (in the Place Maubert you could
do these things) and feverishly assured him that she
loved him with all her heart.</p>

<span class="smaller">A VISIT TO THE ABBAYE OF PORT-ROYAL</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Madeleine’s bitter self-reproaches for her own weakness
were of no avail. She had to acknowledge once
and for all that she had not the force to stand out
against another personality and tell them in cold blood
things they would not like. She could hedge and be
lukewarm—as when Jacques wished to be formally
affianced—but once she had got into a false position
she could not, if the feelings of others were involved,
extricate herself in a strong, straightforward way.
Would God be angry that she had not set up the
Bethel she had promised? No, because it was the true
God she was worshipping now, not merely the projection
of her own barbarous superstitions.</p>

<p>At any rate, to be on the safe side, she would go
and visit Mère Agnès Arnauld at the Abbaye de Port-Royal
(a thing she should have done long ago) for that
would certainly please Him. So she wrote asking if
she might come, and got back a cordial note, fixing
Wednesday afternoon for the interview.</p>

<p>In spite of her exalted mood, she did not look forward
to the meeting: ‘I hate having my soul probed,’
she told herself in angry anticipation. She could not
have explained what hidden motive it was that forced
her on Wednesday to make up her face with Talc,
scent herself heavily with Ambre, and deck herself out
in all her most worldly finery.</p>

<p>As it was a long walk to the Abbaye of Port-Royal—one
had to traverse the whole of the Faubourg Saint-Jacques—Madame
Troqueville insisted on Jacques<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
accompanying her, and waiting for her, during the
interview, at the abbaye gates.</p>

<p>They set out at about half-past two. Jacques seemed
much tickled by the whole proceeding, and said that he
longed for the cap of invisibility that, unseen, he might
assist at the interview.</p>

<p>‘You’ll be a novice ere many months have passed!’
he said, with a mischievous twinkle, ‘what will you
wager that you won’t?’</p>

<p>‘All in this world and the next,’ Madeleine answered
passionately.</p>

<p>‘As you will, time will show,’ and he nodded his
head mysteriously.</p>

<p>‘Jacques, do not be so fantastical. Why, in the name
of madness, should I turn novice just because I visited
a nun? Jacques, do you hear me? I bid you to retract
your words!’</p>

<p>‘And if I were to retract them, what would it boot
you? They would still be true. You’ll turn nun and
never clap eyes again on old Dame Scudéry!’ and
he shrieked with glee. Madeleine paled under her
rouge.</p>

<p>‘So you would frustrate my hopes, and stick a curse
on me?’ she said in a voice trembling with fury. ‘I’ll
have none of your escort, let my mother rail as she
will, I’ll not be seen with one of your make; what are
you but my father’s bawd? Seek him out and get you
to your low revellings, I’ll on my way alone!’ and
carrying her head very high, she strutted on by herself.</p>

<p>‘Why, Chop, you have studied rhetoric in the Halles,
the choiceness of your language would send old Scudéry
gibbering back to her native Parnassus!’ he called
after her mockingly, then, suddenly conscience-stricken,
he ran up to her and said, trying to take her hand:
‘Why, Chop, ’tis foolishness to let raillery work on you
so strangely! All said and done, what power have my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
light words to act upon your future? I am no prophet.
But as you give such credence to my words why then
I’ll say with solemn emphasis that you will <i>never</i> be a
novice, for no nuns would be so foolish as to let a whirlwind
take the veil. No, you’ll be cloistered all your days
with Mademoiselle de Scudéry, and with no other
living soul will you hold converse. Why, there’s a
pleasant, frigid, prophecy for you, are you content?’</p>

<p>Madeleine relented sufficiently to smile at him and
let him take her hand, but she remained firm in her
resolve to forgo his further escort, so with a shrug he
left her, and went off on his own pursuits.</p>

<p>As Madeleine passed through the Porte Saint-Jacques,
she seemed to leave behind her all the noisy operations
of man and to enter the quiet domain of God and
nature. On either side of her were orchards and
monasteries in which, leisurely, slowly, souls and fruit
were ripening. Over the fields of hay the passing
wind left its pale foot-prints. Peace had returned
to her soul.</p>

<p>Soon she was ringing the bell of the Abbaye of Port-Royal—that
alembic of grace, for ever at its silent
work of distilling from the warm passions of human
souls, the icy draught of holiness—that mysterious
depository of the victims of the Heavenly Rape.</p>

<p>She was shown into a waiting-room, bare and
scrupulously clean. On the wall hung crayon sketches
by Moustier of the various benefactors of the House.
Madeleine gazed respectfully at this gallery of blonde
ladies, simpering above their plump <i>décolletage</i>. They
were inscribed with such distinguished names as
Madame la Princesse de Guémené; Elizabeth de Choiseul-Praslin;
Dame Anne Harault de Chéverni; Louise-Marie
de Gonzagues de Clèves, Queen of Poland, who,
the inscription said, had been a pupil of the House,
and whom Madeleine knew to be an eminent Précieuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>Some day would another drawing be added to the
collection? A drawing wherein would be portrayed a
plain, swarthy woman in classic drapery, whose lyre
was supported by a young fair virgin gazing up at her,
and underneath these words:—</p>

<p><i>Madeleine de Scudéry and Madeleine Troqueville, twin-stars
of talent, piety, and love, who, in their declining years
retreated to this House that they might sanctify the great
love one bore the other, by the contemplation of the love
of Jesus.</i></p>

<p>Madeleine’s eyes filled with tears. Then a lay-sister
came in and said she would conduct her to the <i>parloir</i>.</p>

<p>It was a great bare room, its only ornament a crucifix,
and behind the grille there sat a motionless figure—the
Mother Superior, Mère Agnès Arnauld. Her face,
slightly tanned and covered with clear, fine wrinkles,
seemed somehow to have been carved out of a very
hard substance, and this, together with the austere
setting of her white veil, gave her the look of one of the
Holy Women in a picture by Mantegna. Her hazel
eyes were clear and liquid and child-like.</p>

<p>When Madeleine reached the grille, she smiled
charmingly, and said in a beautiful, caressing voice:
‘Dear little sister, I have desired to see you this long
time.’</p>

<p>Madeleine mumbled some inaudible reply. She tried
to grasp the mystical fact that that face, these hands,
that torso behind the grille had been built up tissue
by tissue by the daily bread of the Eucharist into
the actual flesh of God Himself. It seemed almost
incredible!</p>

<p>Why was the woman staring at her so fixedly? She
half expected her to break the silence with some reference
to Mademoiselle de Scudéry, so certain was she that to
these clear eyes her inmost thoughts lay naked to view.</p>

<p>At last, the beautiful voice began again: ‘It would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
seem you have now taken up your abode in Paris. Do
you like the city?’</p>

<p>‘Exceeding well,’ Madeleine murmured.</p>

<p>‘Exceeding well—yes—exceeding well,’ Mère Agnès
repeated after her, with a vague smile.</p>

<p>Suddenly Madeleine realised that the intensity of her
gaze was due to absent-mindedness, and that she stared
at things without seeing them. All the same, she felt
that if this pregnant silence were to continue much
longer she would scream; she gave a nervous little giggle
and began to fiddle with her hands.</p>

<p>‘And what is your manner of passing the time?
Have you visited any of the new buildings?’</p>

<p>The woman was evidently at a loss for something to
say, why, in the name of madness, didn’t she
play her part and make inquiries about the state of
her disciple’s soul? Madeleine began to feel quite
offended.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she answered, ‘I have seen the Palais Mazarin
and I have visited the Hôtel de Rambouillet.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes, the Hôtel de Rambouillet. My cousins
report it to be a very noble fabric. Some day when
the family is in the country you may be able to see
the apartments, which are adorned, I am told, in a most
rare and costly manner.’</p>

<p>So she took it for granted that Madeleine had only
seen the outside! It was annoying, but it was no use
enlightening her, because, even if she listened, she
would not be in the least impressed.</p>

<p>There was another pause, then Mère Agnès turned
on her a quick, kind glance, and said:—</p>

<p>‘Talk to me of yourself!’</p>

<p>‘What manner of things shall I tell you?’ Madeleine
asked nervously.</p>

<p>‘What of theology? Do you still fret yourself over
seeming incongruities?’ she asked with a little twinkle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>‘No,’ Madeleine answered with a blush, ‘most of my
doubts have been resolved.’</p>

<p>‘’Tis well, dear child, for abstracted speculation is
but an oppilation to the free motion of the spirit.
’Tis but a faulty instrument, the intellect, even for the
observing of the <i>works</i> of God, how little apt is it then,
for the apprehension of God Himself? But the spirit
is the sea of glass, wherein is imaged in lucid colours
and untrembling outlines the Golden City where dwells
the Lamb. Grace will be given to you, my child, to
gaze into that sea where all is clear.’</p>

<p>She spoke in a soft, level, soothing voice. Her
words were a confirmation of what Madeleine had tried
to express to Jacques the other day in the garden of
the Place Maubert, but suddenly—she could not have
said why—she found herself echoing with much heat
those very theories of his that had seemed so absurd
to her then.</p>

<p>‘But how comes it that God is good? He commands
<i>us</i> to forgive, while He Himself has need of unceasing
propitiation and the blood of His Son to forgive the
Fall of Adam. And verily ’tis a cruel, barbarous, and
most unworthy motion to “visit the sins of the fathers
upon the children”; a <i>man</i> must put on something
of a devil before he can act thus. He would seem to
demand perfection in us while He Himself is moved by
every passion,’ and she looked at Mère Agnès half
frightened, half defiant.</p>

<p>Mère Agnès, with knitted brows, remained silent for
a moment. Then she said hesitatingly and as if thinking
aloud:—</p>

<p>‘The ways of God to man are, in truth, a great
mystery. But I think we are too apt to forget the
unity of the Trinity. Our Lord was made man partly
to this end, that His Incarnation might be the instrument
of our learning to know the Father through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
Son, that the divine mercy and love, hitherto revealed
but in speculative generals, might be turned into
particulars proportioned to our finite understandings.
Thus, if such mysteries as the Creation, the Preservation,
nay, even the Redemption, be too abstracted, too
speculative to be apprehended by our affections, then
let us ponder the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes,
the tender words to the woman of Samaria, the command
to “suffer the little children to come unto Him,” for they
are types of the other abstracted mercies, and teach
us to acknowledge that God is of that nature, which
knows no conjunctions but those of justice and mercy.
Yes, my child, all your doubts find their resolution in
the life of Jesus. I mind me when I was a girl, in the
garden of the Palais, the <i>arborist du roy</i>—as he was
called—grew certain rare flowers from the Orient to
serve as patterns to the Queen and her ladies for their
embroidery. But when it was determined to build
the Place Dauphine the garden had to go, and with it
these strange blossoms. But the Queen commanded the
<i>arborist</i> to make her a book of coloured plates wherein
should be preserved the form and colour of the Orient
flowers. And this was done, so patterns were not
wanting after all to the Queen and her ladies for their
broidery. Thus, for a time ‘our eyes did see, and our
ears did hear, and our hands did handle’ our divine
Pattern and then He ascended into Heaven, but, in His
great mercy He has left a book wherein in clear,
enduring pigments are limned the pictures of His life,
that we too might be furnished with patterns for our
broidery. Read the Gospels, dear child, read them
diligently, and, above all, hearken to them when they
are read in the presence of the Host, for at such times
the operation of their virtue is most sure.’</p>

<p>She paused, and then, as if following up some hidden
line of thought, continued:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>‘Sometimes it has seemed to me that even sin couches
mercy. Grace has been instrumental to great sins
blossoming into great virtues, and——’</p>

<p>‘Thus, one might say, “Blessed are the proud, for
they shall become meek; blessed are the concupiscent,
for they shall become pure of heart,”’ eagerly interposed
Madeleine, her eyes bright with pleasure over the
paradox.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps,’ said Mère Agnès, smiling a little. ‘I am
glad you are so well acquainted with the Sermon on
the Mount. As I have said, there is no instrument apter
to the acquiring of grace than a diligent reading of the
Gospels; the late Bishop of Geneva was wont to insist
on this with my sister and myself. But bear in mind
the consent and union of design between the holy Life
on earth and the divine existence in Eternity, if one
is pricked out with love and justice, so also is the
other. We should endeavour to read the Gospels with
the apocalyptic eye of Saint John, for it was the peculiar
virtue of this Evangelist that in the narration of particulars
he never permitted the immersion of generals.
The action of his Gospel is set in Eternity. I have ever
held that Spanish Catholicism and the teaching of the
Jesuit Fathers are wont to deal too narrowly with
particulars, whereas our own great teachers—I speak
in all veneration and humility—Doctor Jansen, nay,
even our excellent and beloved Saint Cyran, in that
their souls were like to huge Cherubim, stationary
before the Throne of God, were apt to ignore the straitness
of most mortal minds, and to demand that their
disciples should reach with one leap of contemplation
the very heart of eternity instead of leading them there
by the gentle route of Jesus’ diurnal acts on earth.’</p>

<p>She paused. Madeleine’s cheeks were flushed, and
her eyes bright. She had completely yielded to the
charm of Mère Agnès’s personality and to the hypnotic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
sway of the rich, recondite phraseology which the
Arnaulds proudly called ‘<i>la langue de notre maison</i>.’</p>

<p>‘By what sign can we recognise true grace?’ she
asked, after some moments of silence.</p>

<p>‘I think its mark is an appetite of fire for the refection
of spiritual things. Thus, if an angel appeared
to you, bearing in one hand a cornucopia of earthly
blessings, and in the other, holiness—not, mind, certain
salvation, but just holiness—and bade you make your
choice, without one moment of hesitation you would
choose holiness. Which would <i>you</i> choose?’ and she
looked at Madeleine gently and rather whimsically.</p>

<p>‘I would choose the cornucopia,’ said Madeleine in
a low voice.</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then with a very tender
light in her eyes, Mère Agnès said: ‘I wish you could
become acquainted with one of our young sisters—Sœur
Jacqueline de Sainte-Euphémie Pascal—but she is at
Port-Royal des Champs. She was born with every
grace of the understanding, and affections most sensible
to earthly joys and vanities, but in her sacrifice she has
been as unflinching as Abraham. Hers is a rare spirit.’</p>

<p>Madeleine felt a sudden wave of jealousy pass over
her for this paragon.</p>

<p>‘What is her age?’ she asked resentfully.</p>

<p>‘Sœur Jacqueline de Sainte-Euphémie? She must
be in her twenty-eighth year, I should say. Courage,
you have yet many years in which to overtake her,’
and she looked at Madeleine with considerable amusement.
With the intuitive insight, which from time
to time flashed across her habitual abstractedness, she
had divined the motive of Madeleine’s question.</p>

<p>‘When she was twelve years old,’ she went on, ‘she
was smitten by the smallpox, which shore her of all
her comeliness. On her recovery she wrote some little
verses wherein she thanked God that He had spared her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
life and taken her beauty. Could <i>you</i> have done that?
Alas, when I was young I came exceeding short of it
in grace. I mind me, when I was some ten years old,
being deeply incensed against God, in that He had
not made me “Madame de France”! My soul was
a veritable well of vanity and <i>amour-propre</i>.’</p>

<p>‘So is mine!’ cried Madeleine, with eager pride.</p>

<p>Again Mère Agnès looked much amused.</p>

<p>‘My child, ’tis a strange cause for pride! And bear
in mind, I am the <i>last</i> creature to take as your pattern.
No one more grievously than I did ever fall away from
the Grace of Baptism. Since when, notwithstanding all
the privileges and opportunities of religion afforded by a
cloistered life and the conversation of the greatest
divines of our day, I have not weaned myself from the
habit of sinning. But one thing I <i>have</i> attained by the
instrument of Grace, and that is a “hunger and thirst
after righteousness” that springs from the very depths
of my soul. I tell you this, that you may be of good
courage, for, believe me, my soul was of an exceeding
froward and inductile complexion.’</p>

<p>‘Did you always love Our Lord with a direct and
particular love?’ Madeleine asked.</p>

<p>‘I cannot call to mind the time when I did not.
Do you love Him thus?’</p>

<p>‘No.’</p>

<p>‘Well, so senseless and ungrateful is our natural state
that even love for Christ, which would seem as natural
and spontaneous a motion of our being as is a child’s
love of its mother, is absent from our hearts, before the
operation of Grace. But, come, you are a Madeleine,
are you not? A Madeleine who cannot love! The
Church has ordained that all Christians should bear the
name of a saint whom they should imitate in his or her
particular virtue. And the virtue particular to Saint
Madeleine was that she “loved much.” Forget not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
your great patron saint in your devotions and she will
intercede for you. And in truth when I was young,
I was wont to struggle against my love for Him and
tried to flee from Him with an eagerness as great as
that with which I do now pursue Him. And I think,
dear child, ’twill fall out thus with you.’</p>

<p>Madeleine was deeply moved. Mère Agnès’s words,
like the tales of a traveller, had stirred in her soul a
<i>wanderlust</i>. It felt the lure of the Narrow Way, and
was longing to set off on its pilgrimage. For the
moment, she did not shrink from “the love of
invisible things,” but would actually have welcomed the
ghostly, ravishing arms.</p>

<p>‘Oh, tell me, tell me, what I can do to be holy?’ she
cried imploringly.</p>

<p>‘You can do nothing, my child, but “watch and
pray.” It lies not in <i>us</i> to be holy. Except our soul
be watered by Grace, it is as barren as the desert, but
be of good cheer, for some day the “desert shall blossom
like the rose.” “Watch and pray” and <i>desire</i>, for sin
is but the flagging of the desire for holiness. Grace
will change your present fluctuating motions towards
holiness into an adamant of desire that neither the
tools of earth can break nor the chemistry of Hell
resolve. Pray without ceasing for Grace, dear child,
and I will pray for you too. And if, after a searching
examination of your soul, you are sensible of being in
the state necessary to the acceptance of the Blessed
Sacrament, a mysterious help will be given you of which
I cannot speak. Have courage, all things are possible
to Grace.’</p>

<p>With tears in her eyes, Madeleine thanked her and
bade her good-bye.</p>

<p>As she walked down the rue Saint-Jacques, the tall,
delicately wrought gates of the Colleges were slowly
clanging behind the little unwilling votaries of Philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
and Grammar, but the other inhabitants of the
neighbourhood were just beginning to enjoy themselves,
and all was noise and colour. Old Latin songs, sung
perhaps by Abelard and Thomas Aquinas, mingled with
the latest ditty of the Pont-Neuf. Here, a half-tipsy
theologian was expounding to a harlot the Jesuits’
theory of ‘Probabilism,’ there a tiny page was wrestling
with a brawny quean from the <i>Halles aux vins</i>. Bells
were pealing from a score of churches; in a dozen
different keys viols and lutes and guitars were playing
sarabands; hawkers were crying their wares, valets
were swearing; and there were scarlet cloaks and green
jerkins and yellow hose. And all the time that
quiet artist, the evening light of Paris, was softening
the colours, flattening the architecture, and giving to
the whole scene an aspect remote, classical, unreal.</p>

<p>Down the motley street marched Madeleine with
unseeing eyes, a passionate prayer for grace walling up
in her heart.</p>

<p>Then she thought of Mère Agnès herself. Her rôle
of a wise teacher, exhorting young disciples from suave
spiritual heights, seemed to her a particularly pleasant
one. Though genuinely humble, she was <i>very</i> grown-up.
How delightful to be able to smile in a tender
amused way at the confessions of youth, and to call
one “dear child” in a deep, soft voice, without being
ridiculous!</p>

<p>Ere she had reached the Porte Saint-Jacques she was
murmuring over some of Mère Agnès’s words, but it
was not Mère Agnès who was saying them, but she
herself to Madame de Rambouillet’s granddaughter
when grown up. A tender smile hovered on her lips,
her eyes alternately twinkled and filled with tears:
‘Courage, dear child, I have experienced it all, I
know, I know!’</p>

<span class="smaller">‘HYLAS, THE MOCKING SHEPHERD’</span></h3>

</div>

<p>She reached home eager to tell them all about her
visit.</p>

<p>Her father and Jacques were playing at spillikins
and her mother was spinning.</p>

<p>‘She is a marvellous personage,’ she cried out, ‘her
sanctity is almost corporeal and subject to sense. And
she has the most fragrant humility, she talked of
herself as though there were no more froward and
wicked creature on the earth than she!’</p>

<p>‘Maybe there is not!’ said Jacques, and Monsieur
Troqueville chuckled delightedly. Madeleine flushed
and her lips grew tight.</p>

<p>‘Do not be foolish, Jacques. The whole world
acknowledges her to be an exceeding pious and holy
woman,’ said Madame Troqueville, with a warning
glance at Jacques, which seemed to say: ‘In the name
of Heaven, forbear! This new <i>vision</i> of the child’s
is tenfold less harmful and fantastical than the
other.’</p>

<p>Madeleine watched Jacques grimacing triumphantly
at her father as he deftly extricated spillikin after
spillikin. He was entirely absorbed in the idiotic game.
How could one be serious and holy with such a frivolous
companion?</p>

<p>‘Pray tell us more of Mère Agnès, my sweet. What
were her opening words?’ said Madame Troqueville,
trying to win Madeleine back to good humour, but
Madeleine’s only answer was a cold shrug.</p>

<p>For one thing, without her permission they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
playing with <i>her</i> spillikins. She had a good mind to
snatch them away from them! And how dare Jacques
be so at home in <i>her</i> house? He said he was in
love with her, did he? Yet her entry into the
room did not for one moment distract his attention
from spillikins.</p>

<p>‘Yes, tell us more of her Christian humility,’ said
Jacques, as he drew away the penultimate spillikin.
‘I’ll fleece you of two crowns for that,’ he added in an
aside to Monsieur Troqueville.</p>

<p>‘They are all alike in that,’ he went on, ‘humility is
part of their inheritance from the early Christians,
who, being Jews and slaves and such vermin, had
needs be humble except they wished to be crucified
by the Romans for impudence. And though their
creeping homilies have never ousted the fine old
Roman virtue pride, yet pious Christians do still affect
humility, and ’tis a stinking pander to——’</p>

<p>‘Jacques, Jacques,’ expostulated Madame Troqueville,
and Monsieur Troqueville, shaking his head, and
blowing out his cheeks, said severely:—</p>

<p>‘Curb your tongue, my boy! You do but show your
ignorance. Humility is a most excellent virtue, if
it were not, then why was it preached by Our Lord?
Resolve me in that!’ and he glared triumphantly at
Jacques.</p>

<p>‘Why, uncle, when you consider the base origin
of——’</p>

<p>‘Jacques, I beseech you, no more!’ interposed
Madame Troqueville, very gently but very firmly, so
Jacques finished his sentence in a comic grimace.</p>

<p>After a pause, he remarked, ‘Chapuzeau retailed to me
the other day a <i>naïveté</i> he had heard in a monk’s Easter
sermon. The monk had said that inasmuch as near all
the most august events in the Scriptures had had a
mountain for their setting, it followed that no one could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
lead a truly holy life in a valley, and from this premise
he deduced——’</p>

<p>‘In that <i>naïveté</i> there is a spice of truth,’ Monsieur
Troqueville cut in, in a serious, interested voice. ‘I
mind me, when I was a young man, I went to the
Pyrenees, where my spirit was much vexed by the
sense of my own sinfulness.’</p>

<p>‘I’ faith, it must have been but hypochondria, there
can have been no true cause for remorse,’ said Jacques
innocently.</p>

<p>Monsieur Troqueville looked at him suspiciously,
cleared his throat, and went on: ‘I mind me, I would
pass whole nights in tears and prayer, until at last there
was revealed to me a strange and excellent truth, to
wit, that the spirit is immune against the sins of the
flesh. To apprehend this truth is a certain balm to the
conscience, and, as I said, ’twas on a mountain that it
was revealed to me,’ and he looked round with solemn
triumph.</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville and Madeleine exchanged glances
of unutterable contempt and boredom, but Jacques
wagged his head and said gravely that it was a mighty
convenient truth.</p>

<p>‘Ay, is it not? Is it not?’ cried Monsieur Troqueville,
his eyes almost starting out of his head with eagerness,
triumph, and hope of further praise. ‘Many a time
and oft have I drawn comfort from it.’</p>

<p>‘I have ever held you to be a Saint Augustin <i>manqué</i>,
uncle. When you have leisure, you would do well to
write your confessions—they would afford most excellent
and edifying reading,’ and Jacques’s eyes as he said
this were glittering slits of wickedness.</p>

<p>After supper the two, mumbling some excuse about
an engagement to friends, put on their cloaks and went
out, and Madeleine, wishing to be alone with her
thoughts, went to her own room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>She recalled Mère Agnès’s words, and, as they had
lain an hour or so dormant in her mind, they came
out tinted with the colour of her desires. Why, what
was her exhortation to see behind the ‘particulars’ of
the Gospels the ‘generals’ of Eternity, but a vindication
of Madeleine’s own method of sanctifying her love for
Mademoiselle de Scudéry by regarding it as a symbol
of her love of Christ? Yes, Mère Agnès had implicitly
advised the making of a Robert Pilou screen. <i>Profane
history told by means of sacred woodcuts becomes sacred
history</i>, was, in Mère Agnès’s words, to read history
‘with the apocalyptic eye of Saint John,’ it was to
see ‘generals’ behind ‘particulars.’</p>

<p>But supposing ... supposing the ‘generals’ should
come crashing through the ‘particulars,’ like a river
in spate that bursts its dam? And supposing God were
to relieve her of her labour? In the beginning of time,
He—the Dürer of the skies—on cubes of wood, hewn
from the seven trees of Paradise, had cut in pitiless
relief the story of the human soul. The human soul,
pursuing a desire that ever evades its grasp, while
behind it, swift, ineluctable, speed ‘invisible things,’
their hands stretched out to seize it by the hair.</p>

<p>What if from the design cut on these cubes he were to
engrave the pictures of her life, that, gummed with
holy resin on the screen of the heavens, they might show
forth to men in ‘particulars proportioned to their finite
minds,’ the ‘generals’ cut by the finger of God?</p>

<p>Mère Agnès had said: ‘I was wont to struggle against
my love for Him with an eagerness as great as that with
which I do now pursue Him. And I think, dear child,
’twill fall out thus with you.’ ‘Who flees, she shall
pursue; who spurns gifts, she shall offer them; who
loves not, willy-nilly she shall love.’ Was the Sapphic
Ode an assurance, not that one day Mademoiselle de
Scudéry would love her, but that she herself would one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
day love Christ? What if she had read the omens
wrong, what if they all pointed to the Heavenly
Rape? How could she ever have dreamed that grace
would be the caterer for her earthly desires—Grace,
the gadfly, goading the elect willy-nilly along the
grim Roman road of redemption that, undeviating and
ruthless, cuts through forests, pierces mountains, and
never so much as skirts the happy meadows? That she
herself was one of the elect, she was but too sure.</p>

<p>‘<i>Sortir du siècle</i>’—where had she heard the expression?
Oh, of course! It was in <i>La Fréquente Communion</i>,
and was used for the embracing of the monastic life.
The alternative offered to Gennadius had been to
‘sortir du siècle ou de subir le joug de la pénitence
publique.’ Madeleine shuddered ... either, by dropping
out of this witty, gallant century, to forgo the
<i>vitæ munus</i> or else ... to suffer public humiliation
... could she bear another public humiliation such
as the one at the Hôtel de Rambouillet? Her father
had been humiliated before Ariane ... Jacques had
been partly responsible.... <i>Hylas, hélas!</i> ... the
Smithy of Vulcan ... was she going mad?</p>

<p>In the last few hours by some invisible cannon a
breach had been made in her faith.</p>

<span class="smaller">A DISAPPOINTMENT</span></h3>

</div>

<p>By Friday, Madeleine was in a fever of nervousness.
In the space of twenty-four hours, she would know
God’s policy with regard to herself. Oh! could He
not be made to realise that to deprive her of just this
one thing she craved for would be a fatal mistake?
Until she was <i>sure</i> of the love of Mademoiselle de
Scudéry she had no energy or emotion to spare for
other things. She reverted to her old litany:—‘Blessed
Virgin, Mother of our Lord, give me the friendship of
Mademoiselle de Scudéry,’ and so on, which she
repeated dozens of times on end.</p>

<p><i>This time to-morrow it would have happened; she
would know about it all.</i> Oh, how could she escape
from remembering this, and the impossibility of fitting
a dream into time? Any agony would be better
than this sitting gazing at the motionless curtain of
twenty-four hours that lay between herself and her
fate. Oh, for the old days at Lyons! Then, she had
had the whole of Eternity in which to hope; now,
she had only twenty-four hours, for in their hard little
hands lay the whole of time; before and after lay
Eternity.</p>

<p>Madame Troguin had looked in in the morning and
chattered of the extravagance of the Précieuses of her
quarter. One young lady, for instance, imagined
herself madly enamoured of Céladon of the <i>Astrée</i>, and
had been found in the attire of a shepherdess sitting by
the Seine, and weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>‘I am glad that our girls have some sense, are not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
you?’ she had said to Madame Troqueville, who had
replied with vehement loyalty to Madeleine, that she
was indeed. ‘They say that Mademoiselle de Scudéry—the
writer of romances—is the fount of all these
<i>visions</i>. She has no fortune whatever, I believe,
albeit her influence is enormous both at the Court
and in the Town.’</p>

<p>Any reference to Sappho’s eminence had a way of
setting Madeleine’s longing madly ablaze. This remark
rolled over and over in her mind, and it burnt more
furiously every minute. She rushed to her room and
groaned with longing, then fell on her knees and prayed
piteously, passionately:—</p>

<p>‘Give me the friendship of Mademoiselle de Scudéry.
Give it me, dear Christ, take everything else, but
<i>give me that</i>.’ And indeed this longing had swallowed
up all the others from which it had grown—desire for
a famous <i>ruelle</i>, for a reputation for <i>esprit</i>, for the
entrée to the fashionable world. She found herself
(in imagination) drawing a picture to Sappho of the
Indian Islands and begging her to fly there with her.</p>

<p>At last Saturday came, and with it, at about ten
in the morning, a valet carrying a letter addressed to
Madeleine in a small, meticulous writing. It ran thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Mademoiselle</span>,—A malady so tedious and unpoetical,
that had it not been given the entrée to the
society of <i>les mots honnêtes</i> by being mentioned by
several Latin poets, and having by its intrinsic nature
a certain claim to royalty, for it shares with the Queen
the power of granting “Le Tabouret”; a malady, I
say, which were it not for these saving graces I would
never dare to mention to one who like yourself embodies
its two most powerful enemies—Youth and Beauty—has
taken me prisoner. Mademoiselle’s quick wit
has already, doubtless, solved my little enigma and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
told herself with a tear, I trust, rather than a dimple,
that the malady which has so cruelly engaged me to
my chair is called—and it must indeed have been a
stoic that thus named it!—La Goutte! Rarely has
this unwelcome guest timed his visit with a more
tantalising inopportuneness, or has shown himself
more ungallant than to-day when he keeps a poor
poet from the inspiration of beauty and beauty from
its true mate, wit. But over one circumstance at
least it bears no sway: that circumstance is that I
remain, Mademoiselle, Your sincere and humble
servitor,</p>

<p class="right">‘<span class="smcap">Conrart</span>.’</p>

</div>

<p>In all this fustian Madeleine’s ‘quick wit’ did not
miss the fact that lay buried in it, hard and sharp,
that she was not to be taken to Mademoiselle de
Scudéry’s that afternoon. She laughed. It had so
palpably been all along the only possible climax.
Of course. This moment had always been part of her
sum of experience. All her life, her prayers, and
placations had been but the remedies of a man with
a mortal disease. As often in moments of intense
suffering, she was struck by the strangeness of being
contained by the four walls of a room, queer things
were behind these walls, she felt, if she could only
penetrate them.</p>

<p>Berthe ambled in under pretext of fetching something,
looking <i>espiègle</i> and inquisitive.</p>

<p>‘Good news, Mademoiselle?’ she asked. But
Madeleine growled at her like an angry animal, and
with lips stretched from her teeth, driving her nails
into her palms, she tore into her own room.</p>

<p>Once there, she burst into a passion of tears, banging
her head against the wall and muttering, ‘I hate God,
I hate God!’ So He considered, did He, that ‘no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
one could resist the workings of the inward Grace’?
Pish for the arrogant theory; <i>she</i> would disprove it,
once and for all. Jacques was right. He was a wicked
and a cruel God. All the Jansenist casuistry was
incapable of saving Him from the diabolic injustice
involved in the First Proposition:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Some of God’s Commandments it is impossible for the
just to fulfil.’</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In plain words, the back is <i>not</i> made for the burden.
Oh, the cold-blooded torturer! And the Jansenists
with their intransigeant consistency, their contempt
of compromise, were worthy of their terrible Master.</p>

<p>So, forsooth, He imagined that by plucking, feather
by feather, the wings of her hopes, He could win her,
naked and bleeding, to Him and His service? She
would prove Him wrong, she would rescind His
decrees and resolve the chain of predestination. No,
<i>her</i> soul would never be ‘tamed with frets and weariness,’
<i>she</i> would never ‘pursue, nor offer gifts,’ and,
willy-nilly, <i>she</i> would never love, from the design on
His cubes of wood no print of <i>her</i> life would be taken.</p>

<p>And then the sting of the disappointment pricked
her afresh, and again she burst into a passion of tears.</p>

<p>Pausing for breath, she caught sight of the Crucifix
above her bed. A feeling of actual physical loathing
seized her for her simpering Saviour, with His priggish
apophthegms and His horrid Cross to which He took
such a delight in nailing other people. She tore down
the Crucifix, and made her fingers ache in her attempt
to break it. And then, with an ingenuity which in
ordinary circumstances she never applied to practical
details, she broke it in the door.</p>

<p>A smothered laugh disclosed Berthe crouching by
the wall, her face more than usually suggestive of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
comic mask. Madeleine was seized by a momentary
fear lest she should prove a spy of the sinister ‘Compagnie
du Saint-Sacrement’—that pack of spiritual bloodhounds
that ran all heretics relentlessly to earth—and
she remembered with a shudder the fate of Claude
Petit and le Sieur d’Aubreville. But after all, <i>nothing</i>
could hurt her now, so she flung the broken fragments
in her face and ‘<i>tutoied</i>’ her back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>She went and looked at her face in the glass. Her
eyes were tired and swollen and heavy, and she noted
with pleasure the tragic look in them. Then a sense
of the catastrophe broke over her again in all its previous
force and she flung herself upon her bed and once more
sobbed and sobbed.</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville, when she came in laden with
fish and vegetables from the Halles, was told by Berthe
with mysterious winks that she had better go to
Mademoiselle Madeleine. She was not in the least
offended by Madeleine’s unwonted treatment of her,
and too profoundly cynical to be shocked by her sacrilege
or impressed by her misery. With a chuckle for youth’s
intenseness she had shuffled silently back to her work.</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville flew to Madeleine. Her entry
was Madeleine’s cue for a fresh outburst. She would
not be cheated of her due of crying and pity; she owed
herself many, many more tears.</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville took her in her arms in an
agony of anxiety. At first Madeleine kicked and
screamed, irritated at the possibility of her mother
trying to alleviate the facts. Then she yielded to the
comfort of her presence and sobbed out that Conrart
could not take her to Mademoiselle de Scudéry.</p>

<p>How gladly would Madame Troqueville have accepted
this explanation at its face value! A disappointment
about a party was such a poignant sorrow in youth
and one to which all young people were subject.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
But although she welcomed hungrily any sign of
normality in her child, deep down she knew that <i>this</i>
grief was not normal.</p>

<p>‘But, my angel,’ she began gently, ‘Monsieur Conrart
will take you some other time.’</p>

<p>‘But I can’t wait!’ Madeleine screamed angrily;
‘all my hopes are utterly miscarried.’</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville smiled, and stroked her hair.</p>

<p>‘’Tis foolish to rouse one’s spleen, and waste one’s
strength over trifles, for ’twill not make nor mend
them, and it works sadly on your health.’</p>

<p>Madeleine had been waiting for this. She ground
her teeth and gave a series of short, sharp screams of
tearless rage.</p>

<p>‘For my sake, my angel, for my sake, forbear!’
implored her mother.</p>

<p>‘I shall scream and scream all my life,’ she hissed.
‘’Tis my concern and no one else’s. Ba-ah, ou-ow,’ and
it ended off in a series of shrill, nervous, persistent ‘ee’s.’</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville sighed wearily, and sat silent
for some minutes.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the sobbing, and then Madame
Troqueville began, very gently, ‘Dear, dear child, if
you could but learn the great art of <i>indifference</i>. I
know that....’</p>

<p>But Madeleine interrupted with a shrill scream of
despair.</p>

<p>‘Hush, dear one, hush! Oh, my pretty one, if I
could but make life for you, but ’tis not in my power.
All I can do is to love you. But if only you would
believe me ... hush! my sweet, let me say my say
... if <i>only</i> you would believe me, to cultivate indifference
is the one means of handselling life.’</p>

<p>‘But I <i>can’t</i>!’</p>

<p>‘Try, my dearest heart, try. My dear, I have but
little to give you <i>in any way</i>, for I cannot help you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
with religion, in that—you may think this strange,
and it may be wicked—I have always had but little
faith in these matters; and I am not wise nor learned,
so I cannot help you with the balm of Philosophy,
which they say is most powerful to heal, but one
thing I have learned and that is to be supremely
indifferent—in <i>most</i> matters. Oh, dear treasure....’</p>

<p>‘But I <i>want</i>, I <i>want</i>, I <i>want</i> things!’ cried Madeleine.</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville smiled sadly, and for some
moments sat in silence, stroking Madeleine’s hair,
then she began tentatively,—</p>

<p>‘At times I feel ... that “<i>petite-oie</i>,” as you called
it, frightened me, my sweet. It caused me to wonder
if you were not apt to throw away matters of moment
for foolish trifles. Do you remember how you pleased
old Madame Pilou by telling her that she was not like
the dog in the fable, that lost its bone by trying to
get its reflection, well....’</p>

<p>‘I said it because I thought it would please her,
one must needs talk in a homely, rustic fashion to such
people. Oh, let me be! let me be!’ To have her own
words used against her was more than she could bear;
besides, her mother had suggested, by the way she
had spoken, that there was more behind this storm
than mere childish disappointment at the postponement
of a party, and Madeleine shrank from her
obsession being known. I think she feared that it
was, perhaps, rather ridiculous.</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville gazed at her anxiously for
some minutes, and then said,—</p>

<p>‘I wonder if <i>Sirop de Roses</i> is a strong enough purge
for you. Perhaps you need another course of steel in
wine; and I have heard this new remedy they call
“Orviétan” is an excellent infusion, I saw some in
the rue Dauphine at the Sign of the Sun. I will send
Berthe at once to get you some.’</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PLEASURES OF DESPAIR</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The disappointment had indeed been a shattering
blow, and its effects lasted much longer than the failure
at the Hôtel de Rambouillet. For then her vanity or,
which is the same thing, her instinct of self-preservation,
had not allowed her to acknowledge that she had been
a social failure. But this disappointment was a hard
fact against whose fabric saving fancy beat its wings
in vain. Sometimes she would play with the thought
of suicide, but would shrink back from it as the final
blow to all her hopes. For, supposing she should wake
up in the other world, and find the old longing gnawing
still, like Céladon, when he wakes up in the Palace
of Galathée? She would picture herself floating
invisible round Mademoiselle de Scudéry, unable to
leave any footprint on her consciousness, and although
this had a certain resemblance to her present state,
as long as they were both in this world, there must
always be a little hope. And then, supposing that
the first knowledge that flashed on her keener, freer
senses when she had died was that if only she had persevered
a year longer, perhaps only a month longer, the
friendship of Mademoiselle de Scudéry would have
been hers! She took some comfort from the clammy
horror of the thought. For, after all, as long as she
was alive there must always be left a few grains of
hope ... while <i>she</i> was alive ... but what if one
night she should be wakened by the ringing of a bell
in the street, and running to the window see by the
uncertain light of the lantern he held in one hand, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
<i>macabre</i> figure, looking like one of the Kings in the
pack of cards with which Death plays against Life
for mortal men, the stiff folds of his old-world garment
embroidered with skulls and tears and cross-bones!
And what would he be singing as he rang his
bell?:—</p>

<p>‘Priez Dieu pour l’âme de la Demoiselle de Scudéry
qui vient de trépasser.’</p>

<p>Vient de trépasser! Lying stiff and cold and lonely,
and Madeleine had never been able to tell her that
she loved her.</p>

<p>Good God! There were awful possibilities!</p>

<p>She was haunted, too, by the fear that God had <i>not</i>
deserted her, but had resolved in His implacable way
that willy-nilly she must needs eventually receive His
bitter gift of Salvation. That, struggle though she
would, she would be slowly, grimly weaned from all
that was sweet and desirable, and then in the twinkling
of an eye caught up ‘to the love of Invisible Things.’
‘One cannot resist the inward Grace;’ well, she, at
least, would put up a good fight.</p>

<p>Then a wave of intense self-pity would break over
her that the all-powerful God, who by raising His
hand could cause the rivers to flow backwards to
their sources, the sun to drop into the sea, when
she approached Him with her prayer for the friendship
of a poverty-stricken authoress—a prayer so
paltry that it could be granted by an almost unconscious
tremble of His will, by an effort scarcely strong enough
to cause an Autumn leaf to fall—that this God should
send her away empty-handed and heart-broken.</p>

<p>Yes, it was but a small thing she wanted, but how
passionately, intensely she wanted it.</p>

<p>If things had gone as she had hoped, she would by
now be known all over the town as the incomparable
Sappho’s most intimate friend. In the morning she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
would go to her <i>ruelle</i> and they would discuss the
lights and shades of their friendship; in the afternoon
she would drive with her in le Cours la Reine, where
all could note the happy intimacy between them; in
the evening Sappho would read her what she had
written that day, and to each, life would grow
daily richer and sweeter. But actually she had been
half a year in Paris and she and Sappho had not yet
exchanged a word. No, the trials of Céladon and
Phaon and other heroes of romance could not be compared
to this, for they from the first possessed the
<i>estime</i> of their ladies, and so what mattered the
plots of rivals or temporary separations? What
mattered even misunderstandings and quarrels?
When one of the lovers in <i>Cyrus</i> is asked if there is
something amiss between him and his mistress, he
answers sadly:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Je ne pense pas Madame que j’y sois jamais assez bien
pour y pouvoir être mal.’</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and that was her case—the hardest case of all.
In the old sanguine days at Lyons, when the one
obstacle seemed to be that of space, what would she
have said if she had been told how far away she would
still be from her desire after half a year in Paris?</p>

<p>One day, when wandering unhappily about the Île
Notre-Dame, with eyes blind to the sobriety and
majestic sweep of life that even the ignoble crowd of
litigants and hawkers was unable to arrest in that
island that is at once so central and so remote, she had
met Marguerite Troguin walking with her tire-woman
and a girl friend. She had come up to Madeleine and
had told her with a giggle that they had secretly been
buying books at the Galerie du Palais. ‘They are
stowed away in there,’ she whispered, pointing to the
large market-basket carried by the tire-woman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
‘Sercy’s <i>Miscellany of Verse</i>, and the <i>Voyage à la Lune</i>,
and the <i>Royaume de Coquetterie</i>; if my mother got
wind of it she’d burn the books and send me to bed,’
at which the friend giggled and the tire-woman smiled
discreetly.</p>

<p>‘They told us at Quinet’s that the first volume of
a new romance by Mademoiselle de Scudéry is shortly
to appear. Oh, the pleasure I take in <i>Cyrus</i>,
’tis the prettiest romance ever written!’ Marguerite
cried rapturously. ‘I have heard it said that Sappho
in the Sixth volume is a portrait of herself, I wonder
if ’tis true.’</p>

<p>‘It is, indeed, and an excellent portrait at that, save
that the original is ten times wittier and more <i>galante</i>,’
Madeleine found herself answering with an important
air, touched with condescension.</p>

<p>‘Are you acquainted with her?’ the two girls asked
in awed voices.</p>

<p>‘Why, yes, I am well acquainted with her, she
has asked me to attend her <i>Samedis</i>.’</p>

<p>And afterwards she realised with a certain grim
humour that could she have heard this conversation
when she was at Lyons she would have concluded
that all had gone as she had hoped.</p>

<p>During this time she did not dance, because that
would be a confession that hope was not dead.
That it should be dead she was firmly resolved,
seeing that, although genuinely miserable, she took a
pleasure in nursing this misery as carefully as she
had nursed the atmosphere of her second <i>coup de grâce</i>.
By doing so, she felt that she was hurting something
or some one—what or who she could not have said—but
something outside herself; and the feeling gave
her pleasure. All through this terrible time she would
follow her mother about like a whimpering dog, determined
that she should be spared none of her misery,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
and Madame Troqueville’s patience and sympathy
were unfailing.</p>

<p>Jacques, too, rose to the occasion. He lost for the
time all his mocking ways, nor would he try to cheer
her up with talk of ‘some other Saturday,’ knowing
that it would only sting her into a fresh paroxysm of
despair, but would sit and hold her hand and curse the
cruelty of disappointment. Monsieur Troqueville also
realised the gravity of the situation. On the rare occasions
when the fact that some one was unhappy penetrated
through his egotism, he was genuinely distressed. He
would bring her little presents—a Portuguese orange, or
some Savoy biscuits, or a new print—and would repeat
over and over again: ‘’Tis a melancholy business!
A melancholy business!’ One day, however, he added
gloomily: ‘’Tis the cruellest fate, for these high circles
would have been the fit province for Madeleine and
for me,’ at which Madeleine screamed out in a perfect
frenzy: ‘There’s <i>no</i> similarity between him and me!
<i>none!</i> <span class="allsmcap">NONE!</span> NONE!’ and poor Monsieur Troqueville
was hustled out of the room, while Jacques and her
mother assured her that she was not in the least like
her father.</p>

<p>Monsieur Troqueville seemed very happy about
something at that time. Berthe told Madeleine that
she had found hidden in a chest, a <i>galant</i> of ribbons,
a pair of gay garters, an embroidered handkerchief,
and a cravat.</p>

<p>‘He is wont to peer at them when Madame’s back
is turned, and, to speak truth, he seems as proud of
them as Mademoiselle was of the bravery she bought
at the Fair!’ and she went on to say that by successful
eavesdropping she had discovered that he had won
them as a wager.</p>

<p>‘It seems that contrary to the expectations of his
comrades he has taken the fancy of a pretty maid!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
He! He! Monsieur’s a rare scoundrel!’ but Madeleine
seemed to take no interest in the matter.</p>

<p>The only thing in which she found a certain relief
was in listening to Berthe’s tales about her home.
Berthe could talk by the hour about the sayings and
doings of her young brothers and sisters, to whom
she was passionately devoted. And Madeleine could
listen for hours, for Berthe was so remote from her
emotionally that she felt no compulsion to din her
with her own misery, and she felt no rights on her
sympathy, as she did on her mother’s, whom she was
determined should not be spared a crumb of her own
anguish. In her childhood, her imagination had been
fascinated by an object in the house of an old lady
they had known. It was a small box, in which was
a tiny grotto, made of moss and shells and little
porcelain flowers, out of which peeped a variegated
porcelain fauna—tiny foxes and squirrels and geese, and
blue and green birds; beside a glass Jordan, on which
floated little boats, stood a Christ and Saint John the
Baptist, and over their heads there hung from a wire
a white porcelain dove. To many children smallness
is a quality filled with romance, and Madeleine used
to crave to walk into this miniature world and sail
away, away, away, down the glass river to find the
tiny cities that she felt sure lay hidden beyond the
grotto; in Berthe’s stories she felt a similar charm
and lure.</p>

<p>She would tell how her little brother Albert, when minding
the sheep of a stern uncle, fell asleep one hot
summer afternoon, and on waking up found that two
of the lambs were missing.</p>

<p>‘Then, poor, pretty man, he fell to crying bitterly,
for any loss to his pocket my uncle takes but ill,
when lo! on a sudden, there stood before him a damsel
of heroic stature, fair as the <i>fleurs de lys</i> on a royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
banner, in antic tire and her hair clipped short like a
lad’s, and quoth she, smiling: “Petit paysan, voilà
tes agneaux!” and laying the two lost lambs by his
side, she vanished. And in telling what had befallen
him he called her just “the good Shepherdess,” but
the <i>curé</i> said she could be no other than Jeanne, la
Pucelle, plying, as in the days before she took to arms,
the business of a shepherdess.’</p>

<p>Then she would tell of the little, far-away inn kept
by her father, with its changing, motley company;
of the rustic mirth on the <i>Nuit des Rois</i>; of games of
Colin-maillard in the garret sweet with the smell of
apples; of winter nights round the fire when tales
were told of the Fairy Magloire, brewer of love-potions;
of the <i>sotret</i>, the fairy barber of Lorraine,
who curled the hair of maidens for wakes and marriages,
or (if the <i>curé</i> happened to drop in) more guileless
legends of the pretty prowess of the <i>petit Jésus</i>.</p>

<p>Madeleine saw it all as if through the wrong end of
a telescope—tiny and far-away.</p>

<span class="smaller">FRESH HOPE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>One afternoon Madame Troqueville called Madeleine
in an eager voice. Madeleine listlessly came to
her.</p>

<p>‘I have a piece of news for you,’ she said, looking at
her with smiling eyes.</p>

<p>‘What is it?... Doubtless some one has invited
us to a Comedy,’ she said wearily.</p>

<p>‘No! I came back by the Île and there I chanced
on Monsieur Conrart walking with a friend’—Madeleine
went deadly white—‘And I went up and accosted
him. He has such a good-natured look! I told him
how grievously chagrined you had been when his
project came to naught of driving you to wait upon
Mademoiselle de Scudéry, indeed I told him it had
worked on you so powerfully you had fallen ill.’</p>

<p>‘You didn’t! Oh! Oh! Oh! ’Tis not possible you
told him that!’ wailed Madeleine, her eyes suddenly
filling with tears.</p>

<p>‘But come, my dear heart, where was the harm?’
Madeleine covered her face with her hands and writhed
in nervous agony, giving little short, sharp moans.</p>

<p>‘Oh! Oh! I would liefer have <i>died</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Come, my heart, don’t be so fantastical, he was
so concerned about it, and you haven’t yet heard the
pleasantest part of my news!’</p>

<p>‘What?’ asked Madeleine breathlessly, while wild
hopes darted through her mind, such as Mademoiselle
de Scudéry having confessed a secret passion for her
to Conrart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>‘This Saturday, he is coming in his coach to fetch
you to wait on her!’</p>

<p>Madeleine received the news with a welter of different
emotions—wriggling self-consciousness, mortification
at the thought of Conrart knowing, and perhaps
telling Mademoiselle de Scudéry, how much she cared,
excitement bubbling up through apprehension, premature
shyness, and a little regret for having to discard
her misery, to which she had become thoroughly
accustomed. She trembled with excitement, but did
not speak.</p>

<p>‘Are you pleased?’ her mother asked, taking her
hands. She felt rather proud of herself, for she disliked
taking the field even more than Madeleine did, and
she had had to admonish herself sharply before making
up her mind to cross the road and throw herself on
Conrart’s mercy.</p>

<p>‘Oh! yes ... yes ... I think I am,’ and Madeleine
laughed nervously. Then she kissed her mother and
ran away. In a few minutes she came back looking
as if she wanted to say something.</p>

<p>‘What’s amiss, my dear life?’ Madeleine drew a
hissing breath through her teeth and shut her eyes,
blushing crimson.</p>

<p>‘Er ... did ... er ... did he seem to find it
odd, what you told him about my falling ill, and all that?’</p>

<p>‘Dearest heart, here is no matter for concern.
You see I was constrained to make mention of your
health that it should so work on his pity that he should
feel constrained to acquit himself towards you and——’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but what did you say?’</p>

<p>‘I said <i>naught</i>, my dear, that in any way he could
take ill. I did but acquaint him with the eagerness
with which you had awaited the visit and with the
bitterness of your chagrin when you heard it was
not to be.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>‘But I thought you said that you’d said somewhat
concerning—er—my making myself ill?’</p>

<p>‘Well, and what if I did? You little goose, you——’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but what did you say?’</p>

<p>‘How can I recall my precise words? But I give
you my word they were such that none could take
amiss.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! But <i>what</i> did you say?’ Madeleine’s face
was all screwed up with nerves, and she twisted her
fingers.</p>

<p>‘Oh! Madeleine, dear!’ sighed her mother wearily.
‘What a pother about nothing! I said that chagrin
had made you quite ill, and he was moved to compassion.
Was there aught amiss in that?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, doubtless not. But ... er ... I hope
he won’t acquaint Mademoiselle de Scudéry with the
extent of my chagrin!’</p>

<p>‘Well, and what if he did? She would in all likelihood
be greatly flattered!’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! do you think he will? I’d
<i>kill</i> myself if I thought he had!’</p>

<p>Madame Troqueville gave up trying to reduce
Madeleine’s emotions to reason, and said soothingly,
‘I’m certain, my dearest, he’ll do nothing of the kind,
I dare swear it has already escaped his memory.’
And Madeleine was comforted.</p>

<p>She ran into her own room, her emotions all in a
whirl, and flung herself on her bed.</p>

<p>Then she sprang up, and, after all these leaden-footed
weeks, she was again dancing.</p>

<span class="smaller">‘WHAT IS CARTESIANISM?’</span></h3>

</div>

<p>With the return of hope quite involuntarily Madeleine
began once more to pray. But to whom was she
praying? Surely not to the hard, remote God of the
Jansenists, for that, she knew by bitter experience,
would avail her nothing. Jansenism led straight to
the ‘Heavenly Rape’; of that she was convinced.
If, as in spite of herself she could not doubt, there was
only one God, and He such a Being as the Jansenists
presented Him, then she must not pray, for prayers
only served to remind Him of her existence, and that
He should completely forget her was her only hope
of escape from the ‘ravishing arms.’</p>

<p>But ghostly weapons she <i>must</i> have with which to
fight for success on Saturday. If not prayers, then
something she could <i>do</i>; if not the belief in a Divine
Ally, then some theory of the universe which justified
her in hoping. For in Madeleine there was this much
of rationalism—perverted and scholastic though it
might be—that for her most fantastic superstitions
she always felt the need of a semi-philosophical basis.</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered Jacques’s words in the
Place Maubert: ‘’Tis the will that Descartes writes
of—a magic sword like to the ones in <i>Amadis</i>.’ To
will, was not that the same as to desire? Mère Agnès
had insisted on the importance of desiring. She had
talked about the <i>adamant of desire that neither the tools
of earth can break nor the chemistry of Hell resolve</i>.
Hours of anguish could testify to that adamant being
hers, but what if the adamant were a talisman, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
that in its possession lay the certainty of success?
She must find out about Cartesianism.</p>

<p>She ran into the parlour.</p>

<p>‘Jacques, I would fain learn something of Descartes,’
she cried.</p>

<p>‘Descartes? Oh, he’s the rarest creature! ’Tis
reported he never ceases from sniffling in his nose,
and like Allah, he sits clad in a dressing-gown and
makes the world.’</p>

<p>Monsieur Troqueville cocked an eye full of intelligent
interest and said, in his prim company voice: ‘In
good earnest, is that so?’ But Madeleine gave one
of Jacques’s ringlets a sharp tweak, and asked indignantly
what he meant by ‘dressing-gowns and Allah.’</p>

<p>‘Why, Allah is the Turk’s God,’ then, seeing
that Monsieur Troqueville with pursed-up lips was
frowning and shaking his head with the air of a judge
listening to an over-specious counsel, he added,—</p>

<p>‘Well, uncle, do you lean to a contrary opinion?’</p>

<p>‘All the world is aware that Mohammed is the
Turk’s God—<i>Mohammed</i>. But you have ever held
opinions eccentric to those of all staid and learned
doctors!’</p>

<p>‘Uncle, I would have you know that <i>Allah</i> is the
Turk’s God.’</p>

<p>‘Mohammed!’</p>

<p>‘Allah, I say, and as there is good ground for holding
that he is ever clad in a Turkish dressing-gown, thus....’</p>

<p>‘They dub their God Mohammed,’ roared Monsieur
Troqueville, purple in the face.</p>

<p>‘Mohammed or Allah, ’tis of little moment which.
But I would fain learn something of Descartes’
philosophy,’ said Madeleine wearily.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ began Jacques, delighted to hold forth,
‘’Tis comprised in the axiom, <i>cogito, ergo sum</i>—I think,
therefore I am—whence he deduces....’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, but is it not he who holds that by due exercise
of the will one can compass what one chooses?’ broke
in Madeleine, to the evident delight of Monsieur
Troqueville, for he shot a triumphant glance at Jacques
which seemed to say, ‘she had you there!’</p>

<p>Jacques gave her a strange little look. ‘I fear not,’
he answered dryly; ‘the Will is not the bountiful
beneficent Venus of the Sapphic Ode.’ Madeleine’s
face fell.</p>

<p>‘’Tis the opinion he holds with regard to the power
exercised by the will over the passions that you had
in mind,’ he went on. ‘He holds the will to be the
passions’ lawful king, and though at times ’tis but an
English king pining in banishment, by rallying its forces
it can decapitate “<i>mee lord protectour</i>” and re-ascend
in triumph the steps of its ancient throne. This done,
’tis no longer an English king but an Emperor of
Muscovy—so complete and absolute is its sway over
the passions.</p>

<p>‘There is a pretty dissertation for you, adorned
with a most apt quotation from Corneille. Why,
I could make my fortune in the Ruelles as a Professor
of <i>philosophie pour les dames</i>!’ he cried with an affectionate
little <i>moue</i> at Madeleine, restored to complete
good humour by the sound of his own voice. But
Madeleine looked vexed, and Monsieur Troqueville,
his eyes starting from his head with triumph, spluttered
out, ‘’Twas from <i>Polyeucte</i>, those lines you quoted,
and how does Pauline answer them?</p>

</div>

<p>‘So you see, my young gallant, I know my Corneille
as well as you do!’ and he rubbed his hands in glee.
‘“Le dedans n’est que trouble et que sédition,”
how would your old Descartes answer that? ’Tis
better surely to yield to every Passion like a gentleman,
than to have a long solemn face and a score of devils
fighting in your heart like a knavish Huguenot ...
<i>hein</i>, Jacques? <i>hein?</i>’ (It was not that Monsieur
Troqueville felt any special dislike to the tenets of
Cartesianism in themselves, he merely wished to prove
that Jacques had been talking rubbish.)</p>

<p>‘Well, uncle, there is no need to be so splenetic,
’tis not my philosophy; ’tis that of Descartes, and
though doubtless——’</p>

<p>But Madeleine interrupted a discussion that
threatened to wander far away from the one aspect
of the question in which she was interested.</p>

<p>‘If I take your meaning, Descartes doesn’t teach
one how to compass what one wishes, he only teaches
us how to be virtuous?’</p>

<p>Monsieur Troqueville gave a sudden wild tavern
guffaw, and rubbing his hands delightedly, cried,
‘Pitiful dull reading, Jacques, <i>hein?</i>’</p>

<p>‘You took his book for a manual of love-potions,
did you?’ Jacques said in a low voice, with a hard,
mocking glint in his eyes.</p>

<p>He had divined her thought, and Madeleine blushed.
Then his face softened, and he said gently,—</p>

<p>‘I will get you his works, nor will it be out of your

<span class="smaller">BEES-WAX</span></h3>

</div>

<p>As he had promised, Jacques brought her the works
of Descartes, and she turned eagerly to their pages.
Here, surely, she would find food sweeter to her palate
than the bitter catechu of Jansenism which she had
spewed from her mouth with scorn and loathing.</p>

<p>But to her intense annoyance, she found the third
maxim in the <i>Discourse on Method</i> to be as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>My third maxim was ever to endeavour to conquer
myself rather than fortune, and to change my own desires
rather than the order of the universe. In short, to grow
familiar with the doctrine that ’tis but over our own
thoughts we hold complete and absolute sway. Thus,
if after all our efforts we fail in matters external to us,
it behoofs us to acknowledge that those things wherein
we fail belong, for us at least, to the domain of the impossible.</p>

</div>

<p>Here was a doctrine as uncompromising with regard
to individual desires as Jansenism itself.</p>

<p>Oh, those treacherous twists in every creed and
every adventure which were always suddenly bringing
her shivering to the edge of the world of reality, face
to face with its weary outstretched horizons, its
cruelly clear outlines, and its three-dimensional, vivid,
ruthless population. Well, even Descartes was aware
that it was not a pleasant place, for did he not say
in the <i>Six Meditations</i>:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>But the Reason is that my Mind loves to wander, and
suffers not itself to be bounded within the strict limits of
Truth.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>But were these limits fixed for ever: were we
absolutely powerless to widen them?</p>

<p>A few lines down the page she came on the famous
wax metaphor:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Let us choose for example this piece of Beeswax: it
was lately taken from the comb; it has not yet lost all
the taste of the honey; it retains something of the smell
of the flowers from whence ’twas gathered, its colour,
shape, and bigness are manifest; ’tis hard, ’tis cold, ’tis
easily felt, and if you will knock it with your finger, ’twill
make a noise. In fine, it hath all things requisite to the
most perfect notion of a Body.</p>

<p>But behold whilst I am speaking, ’tis put to the fire,
its taste is purged away, the smell is vanished, the colour
is changed, the shape is altered, its bulk is increased, it
becomes soft, ’tis hot, it can scarce be felt, and now (though
you can strike it) it makes no noise. Does it yet continue
the same wax? Surely it does: this all confess, no one
denies it, no one doubts it. What therefore was there in
it that was so evidently known? Surely none of those
things which I perceive by my senses; for what I smelt,
tasted, have seen, felt, or heard, are all vanished, and
yet the wax remains. Perhaps ’twas this only that I now
think on, to wit, that the wax itself was not that taste of
honey, that smell of flowers, that whiteness, that shape,
or that sound, but it was a body which a while before
appeared to me so and so modified, but now otherwise.</p>

</div>

<p>She was illuminated by a sudden idea—startling
yet comforting. In <i>itself</i> her bugbear, the world of
reality, was an innocuous body without form, sound,
or colour. Once before she had felt it as it really is—cold
and nil—when at the <i>Fête-Dieu</i> the bell at
the most solemn moment of the Mass had rung her
into ‘a world of non-bulk and non-colour.’</p>

<p>Yes, the jarring sounds and crude colours which had
so shocked and frightened her were but delusions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
caused by the lying ‘animal-spirits’ of man. The
true contrast was not between the actual world and
her own world of dreams, not between the design cut
by God’s finger upon cubes of wood and her own
frail desires, but between the still whiteness of reality
and the crude and garish pattern of cross purposes
thrown athwart it by the contrary wills of men.</p>

<p>Well, not only was Jansenism distasteful, but it
was also untrue, and here was a grave doctor’s confirmation
of the magical powers of her adamant of
desire.</p>

<p>The pattern of cross-purposes was but a delusion,
and therefore not to be feared. The only reality being
a soft <i>maniable</i> Body, why should she not turn potter
instead of engraver and by the plastic force of her own
will give the wax what form she chose?</p>

<p>Through her dancing she would exercise her will
and dance into the wax the fragrance of flowers, the
honey of love, the Attic shape she longed for.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Madeleine is following Théodamas (Conrart) into
Sappho’s reception-room. A dispute is raging as to
whether Descartes was justified in regarding Love as
<i>soulageant pour l’estomac</i>. They turn to Madeleine and
ask for her opinion: she smiles and says,—</p>

<p>‘’Twould provide the Faculty with an interesting
<i>thèse du Cardinal</i>, but ’tis a problem that I, at least, am
not fitted to tackle, in that I have never tasted the gastric
lenitive in question.’</p>

<p>‘If the question can be discussed by none but those
experienced in love,’ cries Sappho, ‘then are we all reduced
to silence, for which of us will own to such a disgraceful
experience?’</p>

<p>The company laughs. ‘But at least,’ cries Théodamas,
‘we can all of us in this room confess to a wide experience
in the discreet passion of Esteem, although the spiritual
atoms of which it is formed are too subtle, its motions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
too delicate to produce any effect on so gross an organ
as the one in question.’</p>

<p>‘Do you consider that the heart is the seat of esteem,
or is esteem too refined to associate with the Passion considered
as the chief denizen of that organ from time immemorial?’
asks Doralise.</p>

<p>‘The words “time immemorial” shows an ignorance
which in a lady as full of agreeable information as yourself,
has something indescribably piquant and charming,’
says Aristée, with a delicious mixture of the gallant and
the pedant. ‘For ’tis well known,’ he continues, ‘that
the Ancients held the liver to be the seat of the passion
in question.’</p>

<p>‘Well, then,’ cries Madeleine gaily, ‘these pagans were,
I fear, more evangelical in their philosophy than we, if
they made love and its close attendant, Hope, dwell
together in ... <i>le foie</i>! But,’ she continues, when the
company had laughed at her sally, ‘I hear that this same
Descartes has stirred up by his writings a serious revolt
in our members, what one might call an organic
Fronde.’</p>

<p>‘Pray act as our <i>Muse Historique</i> and recount us
this <i>historiette</i>,’ cries Sappho gaily.</p>

<p>‘Would it be an affront to the dignity of Clio to ask
her to cite her authorities?’ asks Aristée.</p>

<p>‘My authority,’ answers Madeleine, ‘is the organ whom
Descartes has chiefly offended, and the prime mover of
the revolt—my heart! For you must know that the
ungallant philosopher in his treatise on the Passions
sides neither with the Ancients nor the Moderns with
regard to the seat of the Tender Passion.’</p>

<p>‘To the Place de Grèves with the Atheist and Libertine!’
cries the company in chorus.</p>

<p>‘And who has this impious man dared to substitute
for our old sovereign?’ asks Théodamas.</p>

<p>‘Why, a miserable pretender of as base an origin and
as high pretensions as Zaga-Christ, the so-called King
of Ethiopia, in fact, an ignoble little tube called the
Conarium.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>‘Base usurper!’ cries all the company save Sappho,
who says demurely,—</p>

<p>‘I must own to considering it a matter rather for rejoicing
than commiseration that so noble an organ as the
heart should at last be free from a grievous miasma that
has gone a long way to bringing its reputation into ill-odour.
I regard Descartes not as the Heart’s enemy
but rather as its benefactor, as the venerable Teiresias
who comes at the call of the noble Œdipus, desirous of
discovering wherein lies the cause of his country’s suffering.
Teiresias tells him that the cause is none other than the
monarch’s favourite page, a pretty boy called Love.
Whereupon the magnanimous Œdipus, attached though
he is to this boy by all the tenderest bonds of love and
affection, wreathes him in garlands and pelts him with
rose-buds across the border. Then once more peace and
plenty return to that fair kingdom, and <i>les honnêtes gens</i>
are no longer ashamed of calling themselves subjects of
its King.’</p>

<p>As she finishes this speech, Sappho’s eye catches that
of Madeleine, and they smile at each other.</p>

<p>‘Why, Madame,’ cries Théodamas, laughing, ‘the
inhabitant of so mean an alley as that in which Descartes
has established Love, must needs, to earn his bread, stoop
to the meanest offices, therefore we may consider that
Descartes was in the right when he laid down that one of
the functions of Love is to <i>soulager l’estomac</i>.’</p>

<span class="smaller">MADEMOISELLE DE SCUDÉRY’S SATURDAY</span></h3>

</div>

<p>For the next few days Madeleine danced and desired and
repeated mechanically to herself: ‘I <i>will</i> get the love
of Mademoiselle de Scudéry,’ feeling, the while, that
the facets of the adamant were pressing deep, deep
into the wax of reality.</p>

<p>Then Saturday came, and Monsieur Conrart arrived
in his old-fashioned coach punctually at 12.30. She
took her place by his side and they began to roll
towards the Seine.</p>

<p>‘I trust Acanthe will be worshipping at Sappho’s
shrine to-day. His presence is apt to act as a spark
setting ablaze the whole fabric of Sappho’s wit and
wisdom,’ said Conrart in the tone of proud proprietorship
he always used when speaking of Mademoiselle
de Scudéry. Who was Acanthe? Madeleine felt a
sudden pang of jealousy, and her high confidence
seemed suddenly to shrink and shrivel up as it always
did at any reminder that Mademoiselle de Scudéry
had an existence of her own, independent of that
phantom existence of hers in Madeleine’s imaginings.
She felt sick with apprehension.</p>

<p>As they passed from the rue de la Mortellerie into the
fine sweep of the rue Sainte-Antoine the need for
sympathy became peremptory. Conrart had been
giving her a dissertation on the resemblance between
modern Paris and ancient Rome, she had worn a look
of demure attention, though her thoughts were all to
the four winds. There was a pause, and she, to break
the way for her question, said with an admirable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
pretence of half-dazzled glimpses into long vistas of
thought: ‘How furiously interesting. Yes—in truth—there
is a great resemblance,’ followed by a pause, as if
her eyes were held spellbound by the vistas, while Conrart
rubbed his hands in mild triumph. Then, with a sudden
quick turn, as if the thought had just come to her,—</p>

<p>‘I must confess to a sudden access of bashfulness;
the company will all be strange to me.’</p>

<p>Conrart smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, ’twill pass, I dare swear, as soon as you have
seen Sappho. There is an indescribable mixture of
gentleness and raillery in her manners that banishes
bashfulness for ever from her <i>ruelle</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I must confess I did not find it so, to say
truth she didn’t charm me; her ugliness frightened
me, and I thought her manners as harsh as her voice,’
Madeleine found herself saying. Conrart opened his
small innocent eyes as wide as they would go.</p>

<p>‘Tut-tut, what blasphemy, and I thought you
were a candidate for admission to our agreeable city!’
he said in mild surprise. ‘But here we are!’</p>

<p>They had pulled up before a small narrow house
of gray stone. Madeleine tried to grasp the fact in
all its thrillingness that she was entering the door of
Mademoiselle de Scudéry’s house, but somehow or
other she could not manage it.</p>

<p>‘I expect they will be in the garden,’ said Conrart.
‘Courage!’ he added over his shoulder, with a kind
twinkle. In another moment Madeleine was stepping
into a tiny, pleasant garden, shadowed by a fine
gnarled pear-tree in late blossom, to the left was seen
the vast, cool boscage of the Templars’ gardens, and
in front there stretched to the horizon miles of fields
and orchards.</p>

<p>The little garden seemed filled with people all chattering
at once, and among them Madeleine recognised,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
to her horror, the fine figure of Madame Cornuel. Then
the bony form of Mademoiselle de Scudéry, clad in
gray linen, detached itself from the group and walked
towards them. She showed her long teeth in a
welcoming smile. Mignonne, her famous dove, was
perched on her shoulder.</p>

<p>‘This is delicious, Cléodomas,’ she barked at Conrart,
and then gave her hand with quite a kind smile to
Madeleine. ‘Mignonne affirms that all Dodona has
been dumb since its prophet has been indisposed.
Didn’t you, my sweeting?’ and she chirped grotesquely
at the bird.</p>

<p>‘<i>Jésus!</i>’ groaned Madeleine to herself. ‘A child
last time and now a bird!’</p>

<p>‘Mignonne’s humble feathered admirer at Athis
sends respectfully <i>tender</i> warblings!’ Conrart answered,
with an emphasis on ‘tender,’ as he took Mademoiselle
de Scudéry’s hand, still looking, in spite of himself,
ridiculously paternal.</p>

<p>In the meantime the rest of the company had gathered
round them. A distinguished-looking man, not in
his first youth, and one of the few of the gentlemen
wearing a plumed hat and a sword, said in a slow,
rather mincing voice,—</p>

<p>‘But what of <i>indisposed</i>, Monsieur? Is it not a
word of the last deliciousness? I vow, sir, if I might
be called <i>indisposed</i>, I would be willing to undergo
all the sufferings of Job—in fact, even of Benserade’s
<i>Job</i>——’</p>

<p>‘Chevalier, you are cruel! Leave the poor patriarch
to enjoy the prosperity and <i>regard</i> that the Scriptures
assure us were in his old age once more his portion!’
answered Mademoiselle de Scudéry, and the company
laughed and cried ‘Bravo!’ This sally Madeleine
understood, as accounts had reached Lyons of the
Fronde within the Fronde—the half-jesting quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
as to the respective merits of Voiture’s sonnet to <i>Uranie</i>
and Benserade’s to <i>Job</i>—which had divided literary
Paris into two camps, and she knew that Mademoiselle
de Scudéry had been a partisan of Job. However,
she was much too self-conscious to join in the laughter,
her instinct was to try to go one better. She thought
of ‘But Benserade’s Job isn’t old yet!’—when she
was shy she was apt to be seized by a sort of wooden
literalness—but the next minute was grateful to her
bashfulness for having saved her from such bathos.</p>

<p>‘But really, Madame, <i>indisposed</i> is ravishing; is
it your own?’ persisted the gentleman they called
Chevalier.</p>

<p>‘Well, Chevalier, and what if it is? A person who
has invented as many delightful words as you have yourself
shows that his obligingness is stronger than his sincerity
if he flatters so highly my poor little offspring!’
Madeleine gave a quick glance at the Chevalier.
Could it be that this was the famous Chevalier
de Méré, the fashionable professor of <i>l’air galant</i>,
through whose urbane academy had passed all the
most gallant ladies of the Court and the Town? It
seemed impossible.</p>

<p>All this time a long shabby citizen in a dirty jabot
had been trying in vain to catch Mademoiselle de
Scudéry’s eye. Now he burst out with,—</p>

<p>‘A propos of <i>words</i>—er—of <i>words</i>,’ and he spat
excitedly—on Madame Cornuel’s silk petticoat. She
smiled with one corner of her mouth, raised her eyebrows,
then pulling a leaf, gingerly rubbed the spot, and
flung it away with a little <i>moue</i> of disgust. The shabby
citizen, quite unconscious of this by-play, which was
giving exquisite pleasure to the rest of the company,
went on: ‘What do you think then of my word
affreux—aff-reux—a-f-f-r-e-u-x? It seems to me not
unsuccessful—<i>hein</i>—<i>hein</i>?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>‘Affreux?’ repeated an extremely elegant young
man, with a look of mock bewilderment.</p>

<p>‘Affreux! What can it possibly mean, Monsieur
Chapelain?’</p>

<p>‘But, Monsieur, it tells us itself that it is a lineal
descendant of the <i>affres</i> so famous in the reign of
Corneille the Great, a descendant who has emigrated
to the kingdom of adjectives. It is ravishing, Monsieur;
I hope it may be granted eternal fiefs in our language!’
said Mademoiselle de Scudéry courteously to poor
Chapelain, who had begun to look rather discomfited.
Madeleine realised with a pang that Mademoiselle de
Scudéry had quite as much invention as she had herself,
for the friend of her dreams had <i>just</i> enough wit to
admire Madeleine’s.</p>

<p>‘Affreux—it is——’ cried Conrart, seeking a predicate
that would adequately express his admiration.</p>

<p>‘Affreux,’ finished the elegant young man with a
malicious smile. Mademoiselle de Scudéry frowned at
him and suggested their moving into the house. Godeau
(for he was also there) stroked the wings of Mignonne
and murmured that she had confessed to him a longing
to peck an olive branch. Godeau had not recognised
Madeleine, and she realised that he was the sort of
person who never would.</p>

<p>They moved towards the house. Through a little
passage they went into the Salle. The walls were
covered with samplers that displayed Mademoiselle
de Scudéry’s skill in needlework and love of adages.
The coverlet of the bed was also her handiwork, the
design being, somewhat unsuitably, considering the
lady’s virtue and personal appearance, a scene from
the <i>amours</i> of Venus and Adonis. There were also
some Moustier crayon sketches, and portraits in enamel
by Petitot of her friends, and—by far the most valuable
object in the room—a miniature of Madame de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
Longueville surrounded by diamonds. Madeleine
looked at them with jealous eyes; why was not
<i>her</i> portrait among them?</p>

<p>Poor Chapelain was still looking gloomy and offended,
so when they had taken their seats, Mademoiselle de
Scudéry, with a malicious glance at the others, asked
him if he would not recite some lines from <i>La Pucelle</i>.
The elegant young man, who was sitting at the feet
of Mademoiselle Legendre closed his eyes, and taking
out an exquisite handkerchief trimmed with <i>Point du
Gênes</i> with gold tassels in the form of acorns, used it
as a fan. Madame Cornuel smiled enigmatically.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Monsieur, pray give us that great pleasure!’
cried Conrart warmly. Chapelain cleared his throat,
spat into the fireplace and said,—</p>

<p>‘It may be I had best begin once more from the
beginning, as I cannot flatter myself that Mademoiselle
has kept the thread of my argument in her head.’
‘Like the thread of Ariadne, it leads to a hybrid
monster!’ said the elegant young man, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>In spite of Mademoiselle de Scudéry’s assurances
that she remembered the argument perfectly, Chapelain
began to declaim with pompous emphasis,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Je chante la Pucelle, et la sainte Vaillance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui dans le point fatal, où perissait la France,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ranimant de son Roi la mourante Vertu,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Releva son État, sous l’Anglais abbatu.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On he went till he came to the couplet—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Magnanime Henri, glorieux Longueville,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Des errantes Vertus, et le Temple, et l’asile—’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here Madame Cornuel interrupted with a gesture
of apology—‘“L’asile des <i>errantes</i> vertus,”’ she
repeated meditatively. ‘Am I to understand that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
<i>Messieurs les Académiciens</i> have decided that <i>vertu</i>
is feminine?’ Chapelain made an awkward bow.</p>

<p>‘That goes without saying, Madame; we are not
entirely ungallant; <i>les Vertus et les dames sont
synonymes!</i>’ ‘Bravo!’ cried the Chevalier. But
Madame Cornuel said thoughtfully,—</p>

<p>‘Poor Monsieur de Longueville, he is then an <i>hôpital
pour les femmes perdues</i>; who is the Abbess: Madame
his wife or—Madame de Montblazon?’ Every one
laughed, including Mademoiselle de Scudéry, and
Madeleine feverishly tried to repeat her formula ten
times before they stopped. Chapelain stared, reddened,
and began with ill-concealed anger to assure Madame
Cornuel that ‘erring’ was only the secondary meaning
of the word; its primary meaning was ‘wandering,’
and thus he had used it, and in spite of all the entreaties
of Mademoiselle de Scudéry, Conrart, and the Chevalier,
he could not be persuaded to resume his recitation.</p>

<p>Then for a time the conversation broke up into
groups, Mademoiselle de Scudéry devoting herself to
Chapelain, and Madeleine found herself between
Godeau and the Chevalier, who spoke to each other
across her.</p>

<p>‘What of Madame de la Suze?’ asked Godeau.
The Chevalier smiled and shrugged.</p>

<p>‘As dangerous an incendiarist as ever,’ he answered.
‘A hundred Troys burn with her flame.’</p>

<p>‘What a splendid movement her jealousy used to
have; it was a superb passion to watch at play!’</p>

<p>‘Ah! but it is killing her, if another poet’s poems
are praised, it means the vapours for a week.’</p>

<p>‘She must sorely resent, then, the present fecundity
of Mnemosyne.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, for the most part, a <i>galant homme</i> must needs
speak of the Muses to a poetess as ten, but to her we
must speak as if there were but one!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>Godeau laughed.</p>

<p>‘But what ravishingly languishing eyes!’ the
Chevalier went on rapturously.</p>

<p>‘And what a mouth! there is something in its curves
at once voluptuous and chaste; oh, it is indescribable;
it is like the mouth of a Nymph!’ cried the little
prelate with very unecclesiastical fervour.</p>

<p>‘You think it chaste? Hum,’ said the Chevalier
dryly. ‘Her <i>chastity</i>, I should say, belongs to the band
of Chapelain’s “<i>vertus errantes</i>.”’ Godeau gave a noncommittal,
ecclesiastical smile. ‘I was speaking of
her <i>mouth</i>,’ he answered.</p>

<p>‘Ah! what the Church calls a “lip-virtue.” I see.’</p>

<p>Godeau gave another smile, this time a rather more
laïcal one.</p>

<p>‘And what of the charming Marquise, dear Madame
de Sévigné?’ Godeau went on. The Chevalier flung
up his hands in mute admiration.</p>

<p>‘There surely is the <i>asile des vertus humaines</i>!’
cried Godeau. ‘Ah, well, they both deserve an equal
degree of admiration, but which of the two ladies
do we <i>like</i> best?’ They both chuckled knowingly.</p>

<p>‘Yes, <i>Dieu peut devenir homme mais l’homme ne
doit pas se faire Dieu</i>,’ went on Godeau, according
to the fashion among worldly priests of reminding
the company of their calling, even at the risk of profanity.
Then Madeleine said in a voice shaking with
nervousness,—</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think that parallel portraits, in the
manner of Plutarch, might be drawn of these two
ladies?’</p>

<p>There was rather a startled look on Godeau’s ridiculous,
naughty little face. He had forgotten that this
young lady had been listening to their conversation,
and it seemed to him as unsuitable that strange and
obscure young ladies should listen to fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
bishops talking to their intimates, as it was for mortals
to watch Diana bathing. But the Chevalier looked
at her with interest; she had, the moment he had
seen her, entered into his consciousness, but he had
mentally laid her aside until he had finished with his
old friend Godeau.</p>

<p>‘There are the seeds in that of a successful <i>Galanterie</i>,
Mademoiselle,’ he said. ‘Why has it never occurred
to us before to write <i>parallel</i> portraits? We are
fortunate in having for <i>le Plutarque de nos jours</i> a
charming young vestal of Hebe instead of an aged
priest of Apollo!’ and he bowed gallantly to Madeleine.</p>

<p>Oh, the relief to be recognised as a <i>person</i> at last,
and by the Chevalier de Méré, too, for Madeleine was
sure it was he.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur du Raincy,’ he cried to the elegant
young man who was still at Mademoiselle Legendre’s
feet and gazing up into her eyes. ‘We think parallel
portraits of Madame de Sévigné and Madame de La
Suze would be <i>du dernier galant</i>, will you be <i>le
Plutarque galant</i>?’</p>

<p>‘Why not share the task with the Abbé Ménage? Let
him do Mme. de Sévigné, and you, the other!’ said
Godeau with a meaning smile. Du Raincy looked
pleased and self-conscious. He took out of his pocket
a tiny, exquisitely chased gold mirror, examined
himself in it, put it back, looked up. ‘Well, if it is I
that point the contrasts,’ he said, ‘it might be called
“the Metamorphosis of Madame La Marquise de
Sévigné into a <i>Mouche</i>,” for she will be but a <i>mouche</i>
to the other.’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur Ménage might have something to say to
that,’ smiled the Chevalier.</p>

<p>Poor Madeleine had been trying hard to show by
modest smiles of ownership that the idea was hers: she
could have cried with vexation. ‘’Twas my conceit!’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
she said, but it was in a small voice, and no one heard
it.</p>

<p>‘What delicious topic enthralls you, Chevalier?’
cried out Mademoiselle de Scudéry in her rasping
voice, feeling that she had done her duty by Chapelain
for the present. The Chevalier answered with his
well-preserved smile,—</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle, you need not ask, the only topic
that is not profane in the rue de Beauce—the heavenly
twins, Beauty and Wit.’ Madeleine blushed crimson
at the mention of beauty, in anticipation of Mademoiselle
de Scudéry’s embarrassment; it was quite unnecessary,
Sappho’s characteristic was false vanity rather than
false modesty. She gave a gracious equine smile, and
said that these were subjects upon which no one spoke
better than the Chevalier.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle, do you consider that most men, like
Phaon in your <i>Cyrus</i>, prefer a <i>belle stupide</i>—before
they have met Sappho, I need not add—to a <i>belle
spirituelle</i>?’ asked Conrart. Mademoiselle de Scudéry
cleared her throat and all agog to be dissertating,
began in her favourite manner: ‘Beauty is without
doubt a flame, and a flame always burns—without
being a philosopher I think I may assert that,’ and
she smiled at Chapelain.</p>

<p>‘But all flame is grateful—if I may use the expression—for
fuel, and wit certainly makes it burn brighter.
But seeing that all persons have not sufficient generosity,
and <i>élan galant</i> to yearn for martyrdom, they
naturally shun anything which will make their flame
burn more fiercely; not that they prefer a slow death,
but rather having but a paltry spirit they hope, though
they would not own it, that their flame may die before
they do themselves. Then we must remember that
the road to Amour very often starts from the town of
Amour-Propre and wit is apt to put that city to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
sword, while female stupidity, like a bountiful Ceres,
fertilises the soil from her over-flowing Cornucopia. On
the other hand, <i>les honnêtes gens</i> start off on the perilous
journey from the much more glorious city of Esteem,
and are guided on their way by the star of Wit.’</p>

<p>Every one had listened in admiring attention, except
Madeleine, who, through the perverseness of her self-consciousness,
had given every sign of being extremely
bored.</p>

<p>‘I hear a rumour—it was one of the linnets in your
garden that told me—that shortly a lady will make
her début at Quinets’ in whom wit and beauty so
abound that all the <i>femmes galantes</i> will have to
pocket their pride and come to borrow from her store,’
said the Chevalier. Conrart looked important. ‘I am
already in love to the verge of madness with Clélie,’
he said; ‘is it an indiscretion to have told her name?’
he added, to Mademoiselle de Scudéry.</p>

<p>‘The Chevalier de Méré would tell you that it is
indiscreet to the verge of crime to mention the name
of one’s flame,’ she answered with a smile, but she
did not look ill-pleased. So Clélie was to be the name
of the next book! Madeleine for some reason was so
embarrassed and self-conscious at the knowledge that
she did not know what to do with herself.</p>

<p>‘I picture her dark, with hazel eyes and——’ began
Mademoiselle Legendre.</p>

<p>‘And I guess that she is young,’ said Madame Cornuel,
with a twinkle. Du Raincy sighed sentimentally.</p>

<p>‘Well, Monsieur, tell us what is <i>la Jeunesse</i>?’ said
Godeau.</p>

<p>‘La Jeunesse?’ he cried. ‘La Jeunesse est belle;
la Jeunesse est fraîche; la Jeunesse est amoureuse,’
he cried, rolling his eyes.</p>

<p>‘But she rarely enters the <i>Royaume du Tendre</i>,’
said a little man as hideous as an ape—terribly pitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
by smallpox—whom they called Pellisson, with a look
at Mademoiselle de Scudéry. That lady smiled back
enigmatically, and Madeleine found herself pitying
him from the bottom of her heart for having no hope
of ever getting there himself. There was a lull, and
then people began to get up and move away. The
Chevalier came up to Madeleine and sat down by her.
He twisted his moustache, settled his jabot, and
set to.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle, I tremble for your Fate!’ Madeleine
went white and repeated her formula.</p>

<p>‘Why do you say that?’ she asked, not able to keep
the anxiety out of her voice, for she feared an omen
in the words.</p>

<p>‘To a lady who has shown herself the mistress of
so many <i>belles connaissances</i>, I need not ask if she
knows the words of the Roman Homer: <i>Spretæ
injuria formæ</i>?’ Madeleine stared at his smiling,
enigmatical face, could it be that he had guessed
her secret, and by some occult power knew her
future?</p>

<p>‘I am to seek as to your meaning,’ she said, flushing
and trembling.</p>

<p>‘<i>Jésus!</i>’ said the Chevalier to himself, ‘I had forgotten
the prudery of the provinces; can it be she
has never before been accosted by a <i>galant
homme</i>?’</p>

<p>‘<i>Pray</i> make your meaning clear!’ cried Madeleine.</p>

<p>‘Ah! not such a prude after all!’ thought the
Chevalier. ‘Why, Mademoiselle, we are told that
excessive strength or virtue in a mortal arouses in
the gods what we may call <i>la passion galante</i>, to wit,
jealousy, from which we may safely deduce that
excessive beauty in a lady arouses the same passion
in the goddesses.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i>that’s</i> your meaning!’ cried Madeleine, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
relieved that she quite forgot what was expected of
her in the <i>escrime galante</i>.</p>

<p>‘In truth, this <i>naïveté</i> is not without charm!’ thought
the Chevalier, taking her relief for pleasure at the
compliment.</p>

<p>‘But what mischief could they work me—the goddesses,
I mean?’ she asked, her nerves once more
agog.</p>

<p>‘The goddesses are ladies, and therefore Mademoiselle
must know better than I.’</p>

<p>‘But have you a foreboding that they may wreak
some vengeance on me?’</p>

<p>The poor Chevalier felt quite puzzled: this must
be a <i>visionnaire</i>. ‘So great a crime of beauty would
doubtless need a great punishment,’ he said with a
bow. Madeleine felt tempted to rush into the nearest
hospital, catch smallpox, and thus remove all cause
for divine jealousy. The baffled Chevalier muttered
something about a reunion at the Princesse de Guéméné
and made his departure, yet, in spite of the strangeness
of Madeleine’s behaviour, she had attracted
him.</p>

<p>Most of the guests had already left, but Conrart,
Chapelain, Pellisson, and a Mademoiselle Boquet—a
plain, dowdy little <i>bourgeoise</i>—were still there, talking
to Mademoiselle de Scudéry. The Chevalier’s departure
had left Madeleine by herself, so Conrart called out
to her,—</p>

<p>‘A lady who has just been gallantised by the Chevalier
de Méré’ (so it <i>was</i> he!) ‘will carry the memory of perfection
and must needs be a redoubtable critic in
manners; Sappho, may she come and sit on this
<i>pliant</i> near me?’ Madeleine tried to look bored,
succeeded, and looked <i>gauche</i> into the bargain. Conrart
patted her knee with his swollen, gouty hand, and
said to Mademoiselle de Scudéry: ‘This young lady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
feels a bashfulness which, I think, does her credit, at
meeting La Reine de Tendre, Princesse d’Estime,
Dame de Reconnaissance, Inclination, et Terrains
Adjacents.’ The great lady smiled and answered that
if her ‘style’ included Ogress of Alarmingness, she
would cease to lay claim to it. Here was Madeleine’s
chance. Mademoiselle de Scudéry was smiling kindly
at her and giving her a conversational opening. All
she did was to mutter her formula and look with stony
indifference in the opposite direction. Mademoiselle
de Scudéry raised her eyebrows a little and forthwith
Madeleine was excluded from the conversation.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Conrart asked Madeleine if she
was ready to go, and they rose. A wave of inexpressible
bitterness and self-reproach broke over Madeleine as
Mademoiselle de Scudéry took her hand absently and
bade her good-bye. Her new god in a dressing-gown
had loyally done his part, but she, like a fool, had spoiled
it all. And yet, she felt if she had it all over again,
she would be seized by the same demon of perversity,
that again all her instincts would hide her real feelings
under a wall of shields. And Conrart, what would he
think of her? However, he seemed to think nothing
in particular. He was evidently trying to find out
what Madeleine’s impressions of the company had
been, and when she, anxious to make atonement,
praised them enthusiastically, he chuckled with
pleasure, as if her praise enhanced his own self-importance.
‘But the rest of us are but feeble luminaries
compared to Sappho—<i>the most remarkable woman of
the century</i>—she was in excellent vein on Beauty and
Wit.’ It was on the tip of Madeleine’s tongue to say
‘A trifle pedantic!’ but she checked herself in time.
‘She always does me the honour of spending part of
July and August at my little country house. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
delicious to be her companion in the country, the comparisons
she draws between life and nature are most
instructive, as well as infinitely gallant. And like all
<i>les honnêtes gens</i> she is as ready to learn as to instruct;
on a fine night we sometimes take a stroll after supper,
and I give the company a little dissertation on the
stars, for though she knows a thousand agreeable
things, she is not a philosopher,’ he added complacently.</p>

<p>‘Ah, but, Monsieur, a grain of philosophy outweighs
an ounce of agreeable knowledge; there is a solidity
about your mind; I always picture the great Aristotle
with your face!’ Madeleine’s voice was naturally
of a very earnest timbre, and this, helped by her lack
of humour and a halting way of speaking which suggested
sincerity, made people swallow any outrageous
compliment she chose to pay them. Conrart beamed
and actually blushed, though he <i>was</i> perpetual and
honorary secretary of the Academy, and Madeleine
but an unknown young girl!</p>

<p>‘Aristotle was a very great man, Mademoiselle,’
he said modestly. Madeleine smiled. ‘There have
been great men <i>since</i> Agamemnon,’ she said. Really
this was a <i>very</i> nice girl!</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle, I would like you to see my little
<i>campagne</i>——’ he began.</p>

<p>‘That would be furiously agreeable, but I fear I
could not come till the end of July,’ said Madeleine
with unwonted presence of mind.</p>

<p>‘Dear, dear, that is a long while hence, but I hope
we shall see you then.’</p>

<p>‘You are vastly kind, Monsieur; when shall I come?’
Madeleine asked firmly.</p>

<p>‘Well—er—let me see—are you free to come on the
first day of August?’</p>

<p>‘Entirely, I thank you,’ cried Madeleine eagerly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
‘Oh! with what pleasant expectancy I shall await
it!—and you must <i>promise</i> to give me a lesson about
the stars.’ The beaming old gentleman promised
with alacrity, and made a note of the date in his
tablets.</p>

<p>At that moment, Madeleine caught sight of Jacques,
strolling along the Quay, and suddenly filled with a
dread of finding herself alone with herself, she told
Conrart that she saw her cousin, and would like to
join him.</p>

<span class="smaller">SELF-IMPOSED SLAVERY</span></h3>

</div>

<p>‘I knew you would have to pass this way, and I have
been waiting for you this half-hour,’ said Jacques.
‘Well, how went the encounter?’ That Madeleine
was not in despair was clear from the fact that she was
willing to talk about it.</p>

<p>‘Oh! Jacques, I cannot say. Mademoiselle de
Scudéry was entertaining the whole company with
discourse, but when she did address a word to me I
was awkward and bashful—and—and—not over civil.
Do you think she will hate me?’ She waited anxiously
for his answer.</p>

<p>‘Awkward, bashful, and not over civil!’ laughed
Jacques. ‘What did you do uncivil? Did you put
out your tongue and hiccough in her face? <i>Oh</i>, that
you had! Or did you deliberately undress and then
dance about naked? I would that people were more
inclined to such pleasant antics!’</p>

<p>‘In good earnest I did <i>not</i>,’ said Madeleine severely.
‘But I feigned not to be interested when she talked,
and averted my eyes from her as if the sight of her
worked on my stomach. Oh! what <i>will</i> she think
of me?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t know, Chop,’ Jacques said dubiously;
‘it seems you used arts to show yourself in such colours
as ’twould be hard to like!’</p>

<p>‘Do people never take likings to bashful, surly
people?’ she persisted.</p>

<p>‘I fear me they are apt to prefer smooth-spoken,
courtly ones,’ he answered with a smile. ‘But, take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
heart, Chop, you will meet with her again, doubtless, when
you must compel yourself to civility and to the uttering
of such <i>galanterie</i> as the occasion furnishes, and then
the issue cannot choose but be successful. Descartes
holds admiration to be the mother of the other passions;
an you arouse admiration the others will follow of
their own accord.’</p>

<p>‘’Tis easy to talk!’ wailed Madeleine, ‘but her visible
presence works so strangely upon me as to put me
out of all my precepts, and I am driven to unseemly
stammering or to uncivil silence.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Lingua sed torpet, tenuis sub artus Flamma demanat</i>,
etcetera. Have you been studying that most witty
anatomy of the lover in the volume of Catullus that
I lent you?’ asked Jacques, rather mockingly.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Madeleine, blushing. Then, after a
pause,—</p>

<p>‘It seems that ... er ... er ... my father
... that this Ariane ... that, in short, he has
prospered in his suit of late?’</p>

<p>‘Has he? I am exceeding glad to hear it,’ said
Jacques dryly. Then, looking at her with his little
inscrutable smile, he added: ‘You show a most
becoming filial interest in your father’s <i>roman</i>; ’tis
as if you held its issue to be tied up in some strange
knot with the issue of your own.’</p>

<p>How sinister he was looking! Madeleine stared at
him with eyes of terror. She tried to speak but no
sound would come from her lips.</p>

<p>Suddenly his expression became once more kind
and human.</p>

<p>‘Why, Chop,’ he cried, ‘there are no bounds set to
your credulity! I verily believe your understanding
would be abhorrent of no fable or fiction, let them be
as monstrous as they will. In good earnest you are
in sore need of a dose of old Descartes!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>‘But, Jacques, I have of late been diligently studying
him and yet it has availed me nothing. My will has
lost naught of its obliquity.’</p>

<p>‘How did you endeavour to straighten it ...
<i>hein</i>?’ Jacques asked very gently.</p>

<p>Madeleine hung her head and then confessed her
theory about the Wax, and how she had tried upon
reality the plastic force of her will.</p>

<p>Jacques threw out his hands in despair.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Chop!’ he cried, ‘it is a sin to turn to such
maniac uses the cleanest, sweetest good sense that
ever man has penned! That passage about the
wax is but a <i>figure</i>! The only way to compass
what we wish is to exercise our will first on our
own passions until they will take what ply we
choose, and then to exercise it on the passions
of others. Success <i>lies in you</i> but is not to be compassed
by vain, foolish rites after the manner of the
heathen and the Christians. Why, you have made
yourself a slave, bound with the fetters of affrighting
fancies that do but confound the senses and scatter
the understanding. The will is the only talisman.
Exercise yourself in the right using of it against your
next meeting with Mademoiselle de Scudéry, then
when that meeting comes, at one word from you the
bashful humours—docile now—will cower behind your
spleen, and the mercurial ones will go dancing through
your blood up to your brain, whence they will let fall
a torrent of conceits like sugar-plums raining from the
Palais Mazarin, and thus in Mademoiselle de Scudéry
you will arouse the mother of the passions—Admiration.’</p>

<p>They both laughed, and arm in arm—Madeleine
with a serene look in her eyes—made their way to the
petite rue du Paon.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SYMMETRY OF THE COMIC MUSE</span></h3>

</div>

<p>July came, making the perfume of the meadows
more fragrant, the stench of the Paris streets more
foul.</p>

<p>Madeleine had adopted Jacques’s rationalism, and,
having discarded all supernatural aids, was applying
her energies to the quelling of her ‘passions.’</p>

<p>It stood to reason that <i>l’amitié tendre</i> could only
spring from the seeds of Admiration. It behoved
her, then, to make herself worthy of Admiration.
The surest way of achieving this was to perfect herself
in the <i>air galant</i>, and she had the great good fortune
to procure the assistance of one of the most eminent
professors of this difficult art. For the Chevalier de
Méré wrote an elaborate Epistle asking her to grant
him the privilege of waiting on her, which she answered
in what she considered a masterpiece of elegant discretion,
consisting of pages of obscure preciosity ending
in the pleasant sting of a little piquant ‘yes.’</p>

<p>He became an almost daily visitor, and, unfailingly
suave and fluent, he would give her dissertations on
life and manners, filled with that tame, <i>fade</i> common
sense which had recently come to be regarded as the
last word in culture.</p>

<p>She was highly flattered by his attentions, naturally
enough, for he was considered to have exquisite taste
in ladies and had put the final polish on many an
eminent Précieuse. Under his tuition she hoped to
be, by the time of her visit to Conrart, a past-mistress
in the art of pleasing, and to have her ‘passions’ in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
such complete control as to be quite safe from an
attack of bashfulness.</p>

<p>A July of quiet progress—then August and Mademoiselle
de Scudéry! She awaited the issue of this next
meeting with quiet confidence. There is a comfortable
solidity about four weeks, like that of a square
arm-chair in which one can sit at one’s ease, planning
and dreaming. If Madeleine had been gifted with
clarity of vision she would have realised that, for her,
true happiness was to be found nowhere but in that
comfortable, sedentary posture. Only those very
dear to the gods can distinguish between what they
really want and what they think they want.</p>

<p>Berthe was full of sly hints with regard to the
Chevalier, and his visits elicited from her many an
aphorism on the tender passion. She had evidently
given to him the rôle formerly played by Jacques in
her version of Madeleine’s <i>roman</i>.</p>

<p>And what of Jacques? He was naturally very
jealous of the Chevalier and very angry with
Madeleine.</p>

<p>He was now rarely at home in the evenings. Monsieur
Troqueville, who, during the first week of July, was
forced to keep his room by a severe attack of gout,
seemed strangely uneasy.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jacques ceased coming home even to
sleep, and at the mention of his name Monsieur Troqueville
would be threatened by a fit of apoplexy.</p>

<p>When alone with Madeleine he was full of vague
threats and warnings such as: ‘When I get hold of
that rascally cousin of yours, I would see him that
dares prevent me strangling him!’ ‘Have a care lest
that scoundrel Jacques stick a disgrace upon you, as
he has done to me!’ ‘If you’ll be ruled by me you’ll
have none of that fellow! ’Tis a most malicious and
treacherous villain!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>A sinister fear began to stir in Madeleine’s heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After a week’s absence, Jacques appeared at supper,
dishevelled and debonair, with rather a wicked gleam
in his narrow eyes. The atmosphere during the meal
was tense with suppressed emotion, and it was evident
that Monsieur Troqueville was thirsting for his blood.</p>

<p>Supper over, Madeleine made a sign to Jacques to
follow her.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ she asked him, once they were in her
own room.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ he answered, smiling enigmatically.</p>

<p>‘You have been about some mischief—I know it
well. Recount me the whole business without delay.’</p>

<p>‘Some mischief? ’Tis merely that I have been
driving the playwright’s trade and writing a little
comedy, on life instead of on foolscap.’</p>

<p>‘I do not take your meaning.’</p>

<p>‘No? Have you ever remarked that Symmetry is
the prettiest attribute of the Comic Muse? Here is
my cast—two Belles and one Gallant. Belle I. loathes
the Gallant like the seven deadly sins, while he most
piteously burns with her flame, and has been hoodwinked
by his own vanity and the persuasions of a
friend that she burns as piteously with his. Now,
mark the inverted symmetry—the Gallant loathes
Belle II., while she burns with his flame and is persuaded
that he does with hers. Why, the three are as prettily
interrelated as a group of porcelain figures! I am of
opinion that Comedy is naught but Life viewed
geometrically.’</p>

<p>‘You talk in riddles, Jacques, and I am entirely
without clue to your meaning—save that it is
some foolishness,’ cried Madeleine with intense irritation.
Jacques’s only answer was an inscrutable smile.</p>

<p>‘Read me your riddle without delay, or you’ll have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
me stark mad with your nonsense!’ she cried with
tears of suspense and impatience in her eyes.</p>

<p>So Jacques told her how after his first rebuff Monsieur
Troqueville had for a time ceased to pester
Ariane with his addresses, and had found balm for his
hurt vanity in pretending to his tavern companions
that his success with Ariane had been complete, and
that he held her heart in the hollow of his hand. He
had almost come to believe this himself, when one evening
his friends in the tavern, who had of course never
believed his story, had insisted on seeing Ariane in
the flesh. It was in vain that Monsieur Troqueville
had furiously reiterated that ‘the lady being no common
bawd, but exceeding dainty of her favours, would
never stoop to such low company as theirs.’ The
company was obdurate, reiterating that unless they
saw her with their own eyes they would hold his
‘<i>Chimène</i>’ to be but a ‘<i>chimère</i>,’ and that like Troy
in Euripides’ fable, it was but for a phantom lady
that he burned. Finally, Monsieur Troqueville, goaded
beyond all endurance, vowed that the lady would be
with them ere an hour was passed. The company
agreed that if he did not keep his word he would have
to stand drinks all round and kiss their grim Huguenot
hostess, while if Ariane appeared within an hour they
would give him as brave a <i>petite-oie</i> as their joint
purses could afford. (At the words ‘<i>petite-oie</i>’ Madeleine
went pale.) Once outside the tavern Monsieur
Troqueville gave way to despair, and Jacques was so
sorry for him that although he felt certain the business
would end in ridicule for them both, he rushed to
Ariane’s house to see if he could move her to pity.
Fortunately he found her alone and bored—and took
her fancy. To cut a long story short, before the hour
was up, amid the cheers of the revellers and the Biblical
denunciations of the hostess, Ariane made her epiphany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
at the tavern and saved Monsieur Troqueville’s face.
After that Jacques went often to see Ariane, and
delivered the love-letters he carried from Monsieur
Troqueville, not to her but to her ancient duenna, in
whose withered bosom he had easily kindled a flame
for his uncle. Finally, having promised him a meeting
with his lady, he had thrown him into the arms of
the duenna.</p>

<p>When Jacques had finished his story, Madeleine,
who had gazed at him with a growing horror in her
eyes, said slowly,—</p>

<p>‘To speak truth, you seem to me compact of cruelty.’
At once he looked penitent. ‘No, Chop, ’tis not my
only humour. One does not hold Boisrobert and the
other writers of Comedy to be cruel in that they devise
droll situations for their characters.’</p>

<p>‘That is another matter.’</p>

<p>‘Well, maybe you are in the right. ’Twas a scurvy
trick I played him, and I am ashamed. Are you
grievously wroth with me, Chop?’</p>

<p>‘I can hardly say,’ she answered and, her eyes
wandering restlessly over the room, she twisted her
hands in a way she had when her nerves were taut.
‘There are times when I am wont to wonder ...
if haply I do not somewhat resemble my father,’ she
added with a queer little laugh.</p>

<p>The idea seemed to tickle Jacques. She looked at
him angrily.</p>

<p>‘You hold then that there is truth in what I say?’
and try as she would she could not get him to say that
there was not.</p>

<span class="smaller">BERTHE’S STORY</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Madeleine was feeling restless, so she asked Berthe
to come and sit by her bed and talk to her.</p>

<p>‘Tell me a story,’ she commanded, and Berthe
delightedly launched forth on her favourite theme, that
of Madeleine’s resemblance to her youngest brother.</p>

<p>‘Oh, he often comes to me and says, “Tell me a
story, Berthe,” like that, “tell me a story, Berthe,”
and I’ll say, “Do you think I have nothing better
to do, sir, than tell you stories. Off you go and dig
cabbages;” and he’ll say, with a bow, “Dig them
yourself, Madame”—oh, he’s <i>malin</i>, ever pat with
an answer; he is like Monsieur Jacques in that way.
One day——’</p>

<p>‘Please tell me a story,’ Madeleine persisted. ‘Tell
me the one about Nausicaa.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! that was the one that came back to me when
Mademoiselle turned with such zeal to housewifery!’
and she chuckled delightedly.</p>

<p>‘Tell it to me!’</p>

<p>‘Well, it was a pretty tale my grandmother used
to tell; she heard it from <i>her</i> grandmother, who had
been tire-woman to a great lady in the reign of good
King Francis.’</p>

<p>‘Begin the tale,’ commanded Madeleine firmly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mademoiselle will have her own way—just
like Albert,’ winked Berthe, and began,—</p>

<p>‘Once upon a time, hundreds of years ago, there
lived a rich farmer near Marseilles. My grandmother
was wont to say he was a king, but that cannot have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
been, for, as you will see, his daughter did use to do
her own washing. Mademoiselle hates housework,
doesn’t she? <i>I</i> can see you are ill-pleased when Madame
talks of a <i>ménage</i> of your own——’</p>

<p>‘<i>Go on</i>,’ said Madeleine. Berthe cackled, ‘Just like
Albert!’ she exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘Well, this farmer had an only daughter, who was
very beautiful; she had an odd name: it was Nausicaa.
She was <i>rêveuse</i>, like Mademoiselle and me, and used
to love to lie in her father’s orchard reading romances
or looking out over the sea, which lay below. She did
not care for the sons of the farmers round that came
wooing her with presents of lambs and apples or with
strings of beads which they bought from sailors at
the harbour; they seemed to her clumsy with their
foolish grins and their great hands, for Nausicaa was
exceeding nice,’ and Berthe winked meaningly. ‘And
there were merchants, too, with long beards and grave
faces, and gold chains, who sought her hand, but she
was aware that they looked on her as nothing better
than the rare birds their ships brought them from
the Indies. Well, one night, Our Lady appeared to
her in a dream and said: “Lève-toi, petite paresseuse,
les jeunes demoiselles doivent s’occuper du mariage
et de leur ménage.” And she bade Nausicaa go to the
river, and wash all her linen, for if a Prince came he
would be ill-pleased to find her foul. And Nausicaa
woke up feeling very strange and as if fair wondrous
things were coming to meet her. ’Tis a fancy that
seizes us all at times, and much good it does us!’
And Berthe gave her long, soft chuckle, while Madeleine
scowled at her.</p>

<p>‘As soon as she was dressed, Nausicaa ran into the
fields to find her father, and she put her arms round
his neck and hid her face on his shoulder and said,
laughing,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>‘“Father, I am fain you should lend me a cart and
four mules for to-day,” and her brothers, who were
standing near, laughed and asked who was waiting
for her at the other end. And Nausicaa tossed her
head and said she did but want to wash her linen in
the river. And her father pinched her ear and kissed
her and said that he would order four of his best mules
to be harnessed. And when her mother heard of her
project she clapped her hands with joy and winked
at the old nurse, for she divined the thought in
Nausicaa’s mind, and the poor soul was exceeding glad.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Go on</i>,’ Madeleine commanded feverishly, forestalling
a personal deviation.</p>

<p>‘Well, the mother filled a big hamper full of the
delicate fare that Nausicaa liked best—<i>pain d’épice</i>,
and quince jam and preserved fruits and a fine fat capon,
and bade four or five of the dairymaids go with her
and help her with her washing, and Nausicaa filled a
great basket with her linen, and they all climbed into
the cart, and Nausicaa took the reins and flicked the
whip, and the mules trotted off. When they got to
the river they rolled up their sleeves and set to, and
they laughed and talked over their work, for Nausicaa
was not proud. And when all the linen was washed
and laid out on the grass to dry they sat down and
ate their dinner and talked, and Nausicaa sang them
songs, for she had brought her lute with her. And
then they played at <i>Colin-Maillard</i> and at ball, and
then they danced a <i>Branle</i>, and poor grannie used always
to say that they were as lovely as the angels dancing
in Paradise. Every one, of course, was comely long
ago’—and Berthe interrupted her narration to chuckle.</p>

<p>‘Grannie used always to go on like this: “They
laughed and played as maidens will when they are
among themselves, but they little knew what was
watching them from behind a bush of great blue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
flowers,” and we used to say, with our eyes as round
as buttons—“Was it a bear, grannie?” “No.”
“Was it a <i>lutin</i>, then?” And we were grievously
disappointed when she would say, “No, it was a man!”
Well, it was a great Roman lord called Ulysse who
had fought with Charlemagne at the Siege of Troy,
and when he started on his voyage home, Saint
Nicholas, the sailors’ saint, who did not love him,
pestered him with storms and shipwrecks and monstrous
fish so that the years passed and he got no nearer home.
And all the time he kept on praying to Our Lady to
give him a safe and speedy return, and at last she heard
his prayer, and when Saint Nicholas had once again
wrecked his ship she rescued him from the sea and
walked over the waves with him in her arms as if he
were a little child till she reached the river near Marseilles,
and then she laid him among the rushes by
its banks, and there he slept. And when he woke up
she worked a miracle so that the wrinkles and travel-stains
and sunburn dropped away from him, and his
rags she changed into a big hat with fine plumes, and
a jerkin of Isabelle satin, and a cloak lined with
crimson plush, and breeches covered with ribbons,
so that he was once more the fine young gallant that
had years ago started for the wars. And she told him
to step out from behind the bush and accost Nausicaa.
Oh, believe me, he knew what to say, for he was as
<i>malin</i> as a fox! He made as fine a bow as you could
see and told Nausicaa that she must be a king’s daughter.
And her heart was fluttering like a bird—poor, pretty
soul!—as she remembered her dream. Not that she
had need to call it to mind, for, as Mademoiselle doubtless
will understand, she had thought of nothing else
all day!’ Madeleine looked suspiciously at the comic
mask, but Berthe went on,—</p>

<p>‘And then my lord Reynard tells of his misfortunes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
and the hours he had spent struggling in the cold sea,
and of his hunger, and of how his ship was lost, and he
longing for his own country, “until I saw Mademoiselle,”
with another bow, so that tears came to the eyes of
Nausicaa and her maids, and shyly kind, she asked him
if he would be pleased to take shelter under her father’s
roof, which, as you will believe, was just what he had
been waiting for! And her parents welcomed the
handsome stranger kindly, the father as man to man,
the mother a little shyly, for she saw that he was a
great lord, though he did not tell his name, and she
feared that he might think poorly of their state. All
the same, her mind was busy weaving fantasies, and
when she told them to her husband he mocked her for
a vain and foolish woman, but for all that, he looked
troubled and not well pleased. Nausicaa did not tell
her parents of her dream, but that evening when her
old nurse was combing her hair—my grannie used to
say it was a comb made of pink coral—she asked her
whether she thought that dreams might be taken as
omens, and the old woman, who from the question
divined the truth, brought out a dozen cases of dreams
coming true.’</p>

<p>‘Does it end happily?’ Madeleine interrupted
feverishly.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle will see,’ chuckled Berthe, her expression
inexpressibly sly.</p>

<p>‘Don’t look so strangely, Berthe, you frighten me!’
cried Madeleine. She was in a state of great nervous
excitement.</p>

<p>‘But, Mademoiselle, it is only a tale—it is <i>just</i> like
Albert, he will sometimes cry his eyes out over a sad
tale. I remember one evening at the Fête des Rois, the
Curé——’</p>

<p>‘Go on with the story,’ cried Madeleine.</p>

<p>‘Where was I? Oh, yes.... Well, Ulysse stayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
with them some days, and he would borrow a blue
smock from one of Nausicaa’s brothers and help to
bring in the hay, and in the evening tell them stories
of strange countries or play to them on the lute. And
he would wander with Nausicaa in the orchard, and
though his talk was pretty and full of <i>fleurettes</i>, he never
spoke of love. Well, one evening a Troubadour—Mademoiselle
knows what that is?’</p>

<p>‘Of course!’</p>

<p>‘Came to the door and they asked him in, and after
supper he sang them songs all about the Siege of Troy
and the hardships undergone by Charlemagne and
his knights when they fought there for <i>la belle Hélène</i>,
and as he listened Ulysse could not keep from weeping,
and they watched him, wondering. And when the
song was finished they were all silent. And then
Ulysse spoke up, saying he would no longer keep his
name from them—“and, indeed,” he added proudly,
“it is not a name that need make its bearer blush,
for,” said he, “I am the lord Ulysse!” At that they
all exclaimed with wonder, and Nausicaa turned as
white as death, but Ulysse did not look at her. Then
he told them of all the troubles sent him by Saint
Nicholas and how fain he was to get to his own country
and to his lady who was waiting for him in a high
tower, but that he had no ship. Then Nausicaa’s father
clapped him on the shoulder, although he was such
a great lord, and told him that he had some ships of
his own to carry his corn to barren countries like
England, and that he should have one to take him
home. Then he filled up their glasses with good red
Beaume and drank to his safe arrival, but Nausicaa
said never a word and left the room. And next morning
she was there, standing by a pillar of the door to bid
him godspeed, smiling bravely, for though she was
but a farmer’s daughter she had a <i>noble fierté</i>. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
after he had gone she could do nothing but weep, and
pray to the Virgin to send her comfort. And some tell
that in time she forgot the lord Ulysse and the grievous
sorrow he had brought on her, and wedded with a
neighbouring farmer and gat him fair children.</p>

<p>‘But others tell that the poor soul could not rid
herself of the burden of her grief, but did use to pass
the nights in weeping and the days in roaming, wan
and cheerless, by the sea-waves or through the meadows.
And one eve as she wandered thus through a field of
corn, it chanced that one of God’s angels was flying
overhead, and he saw the damsel, and his strange
bloodless heart was filled with love and pity of her,
and he swooped down on her and caught her up to
Paradise.</p>

<p>‘ ... There is Madame calling me!’ and Berthe
hurried from the room.</p>

<p>Madeleine lay quite still on her bed, with a frightened
shadow in her eyes. Ever since Jacques’s dissertation
on the Symmetry of the Comic Muse, terror had been
howling outside the doors of her soul, but now it had
boldly entered and taken possession.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CHRISTIAN VENUS</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The sane and steady procedure of the last few weeks—to
prepare for the arousing of Admiration in Mademoiselle
de Scudéry by a course in the art of pleasing—now
seemed to Madeleine inadequate and frigid. She felt
she could no longer cope with life without supernatural
aid.</p>

<p>Once more her imagination began to pullulate with
tiny nervous fears.</p>

<p>There would be onions for dinner—a vegetable
that she detested. She would feel that unless she
succeeded in gulping down her portion before her
father gave another hiccough, she would never gain
the friendship of Mademoiselle de Scudéry. She would
wake up in the middle of the night with the conviction
that unless, standing on one leg, she straightway
repeated ‘<i>cogito, ergo sum</i>’ fifteen times, Conrart would
be seized by another attack of gout which would
postpone her visit.</p>

<p>But these little fears—it would be tedious to
enumerate them all—found their source in one great
fear, to wit <i>lest the Sapphic Ode and the adventures of
Nausicaa formed one story</i>.</p>

<p>The Ode tells how Venus appeared to Sappho and
promised her rare things; but were these promises
fulfilled? The Ode does not tell us, but we know that
Sappho leapt from a cliff into the cold sea. The Virgin
appears to Nausicaa, and although her promises are not
as explicit as those of Venus, they are every whit as
enticing, and what do they lead to? To a maiden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
disillusioned, deserted, and heart-broken, finding her
final consolation in the cold and ravishing embraces
of an Angel.</p>

<p>She, too, by omens and signs had been promised
rare things; she had abandoned God, but had she
ceased to believe in His potency? She remembered
the impression left on Jacques by the fourth book of
the <i>Eneid</i>, and Descartes’ discarded hypothesis of
an evil god, <i>le grand trompeur</i>—the ‘great cheat,’ he
had called Him. Perhaps He had sent the Virgin to
Nausicaa, Dame Venus to Sappho, and to herself a
constellation of auspicious stars, to cozen them with
fair promises that He might have the joy of breaking
them—and their hearts as well.</p>

<p>One evening when her nerves were nearly cracking
under the strain of this idea, she went to the kitchen
to seek out Berthe.</p>

<p>‘Berthe,’ she said, ‘when you do strangely desire
a thing shall come to pass, what means do you affect
to compass it?’</p>

<p>Berthe gave her a sly look and answered: ‘I burn a
candle to my patron saint, Mademoiselle.’</p>

<p>‘And is the candle efficacious to the granting of
your prayers?’</p>

<p>‘As to their granting, it hangs upon the humour of
Saint Berthe.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know of any charm that will so work upon
her as to change her humour from a splenetic to a
kindly one?’</p>

<p>‘There is but two charms, Mademoiselle, that will
surely work upon the humours of the great—be they
in Paradise or on the earth—they be flattery and
presents. Albeit, I am a good Catholic, I hold my
own opinions on certain matters, and I cannot doubt
that once the Saints are safe in Paradise they turn
exceeding grasping, crafty, and malicious. Like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
financiers, they are glutted on the farthings of the
poor—a pack of Montaurons!’</p>

<p>‘And in what manner does one flatter them?’</p>

<p>‘Why, by novenas and candles and prostrating
oneself before their images. As for me, except I have
a prayer I strangely desire should be granted, I do
never affect to kneel at Mass, I do but bend forward
in my seat. In Lorraine we hold all this bowing and
scraping as naught but Spanish tomfoolery! You’d
seek long before you found one of <i>us</i> putting ourselves
to any discomfort for the Saints, except it did profit
us to do so!’ and for at least a minute she chuckled
and winked.</p>

<p>Well, here was a strange confirmation of her theory—a
wicked hierarchy could only culminate in a wicked
god. Yes, but such ignoble Saints would surely not
be incorruptible. Might not timely bribes change
their malicious designs? Also, it was just possible
that Nausicaa and Sappho had neglected the rites and
sacrifices without which no compact is valid between
a god and a mortal. But could she not learn from
their sad example? <i>Her</i> story was still in the making,
by timely rites she might bring it to a happy issue.</p>

<p>With a sudden flash of illumination she felt she
had discovered the secret of her failure. It was due
to her neglect of her own patron saint, Saint Magdalene,
who was as well the patron saint of Madeleine de
Scudéry, a mystic link between their two souls,
without which they could never be united.</p>

<p><i>Forget not your great patron saint in your devotions.
It was her particular virtue that she greatly loved</i>, had
been the words of Mère Agnès. <i>She greatly loved</i>—why,
it was all as clear as day; was she not the holy
courtesan, and as such had she not taken over the
functions of the pagan Venus, she who had appeared
to Sappho? As the Christian Venus, charm and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
beauty and wit and <i>l’air galant</i>, and all the qualities
that inspire Admiration must be in her gift, and
Madeleine had neglected her! It was little wonder
she had failed. Why, at the very beginning of her
campaign against <i>amour-propre</i> she should have
invoked her aid—‘the saint who so greatly loved.’</p>

<p>Thus, link by link, was forged a formidable chain
of evidence proving the paramount importance of the
cult of Saint Magdalene.</p>

<p>What could she do to propitiate her? The twenty-second
of July was her Feast, just a few days
before the visit to Conrart. That was surely a
good omen. She made a rapid calculation and found
that it would fall on a Sunday, what if ... she
shuddered, for something suddenly whispered to her
soul a sinister suggestion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That afternoon the Chevalier de Méré came to wait
on her, and in the course of his elegantly didactic
monologue, Madeleine inadvertently dropped her
handkerchief: he sprang to pick it up, and as he
presented it to her apostrophised it with a languorous
sigh,—</p>

<p>‘Ah, little cambric flower, it would not have taken
a seer to foretell that happiness as exquisite as yours
should precede a fall!’</p>

<p>Then, according to his custom of following up a
concrete compliment by a dissertation on the theory
of <i>Galanterie</i> he launched into an historical survey of
the use to which the <i>Muse Galante</i> had made, in countless
admirable sonnets, of the enviable intimacy existing
between their fair wearer and such insensible objects
as a handkerchief or a glove.</p>

<p>‘But these days,’ he continued, ‘the envy of a poet
<i>à la mode</i> is not so much aroused by gloves of <i>frangipane</i>
and handkerchiefs of Venetian lace, in that a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
franchise far greater than <i>they</i> have ever enjoyed has
been granted by all the Belles of the Court and Town to
ignoble squares of the roughest cloth—truly evangelical,
these Belles have exalted the poor and meek and——’</p>

<p>‘I don’t take your meaning, pray explain,’ Madeleine
cut in.</p>

<p>‘Why, dear Rhodanthos, have you never heard of Mère
Madeleine de Saint-Joseph of the Carmelites?’</p>

<p>‘That I have, many a time.’</p>

<p>‘Well, as you know, in her life time she worked
miracles beyond the dreams of Faith itself, and at
her death, as in the case of the founder of her Order,
the great Elias, her virtue was transmitted to her
cloak, or rather to her habit, portions of which fortunate
garment are worn by all the <i>belles dévotes</i> next ...
er ... their ... er next ... er ... their sk ...
next their secret garden of lilies, with, I am told, the
most extravagant results; it is her portion of the miraculous
habit that has turned Madame de Longueville
into a penitent, for example, but its effects are sometimes
of a more profane nature, namely—breathe it
low—success in the tender passion!’ Madeleine’s
eyes grew round.</p>

<p>‘Yes, ’tis a veritable cestus of Venus, which, I need
hardly remind a lady of such elegant learning as
Mademoiselle, was borrowed by Juno when anxious
to rekindle the legitimate passion in the bosom of Jove.
And speaking of Juno I remember——’</p>

<p>But Madeleine had no more attention to bestow on
the urbane flow of the Chevalier’s conversation. She
was ablaze with excitement and hope ... Mère
<i>Madeleine</i> de Saint-Joseph, the mystical name again!
And the cestus of Venus ... it was surely a message
sent from Saint Magdalene herself. The Chevalier
had said that these relics had usurped the rôle previously
played in the world of fashion by lace handkerchiefs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
and gloves of <i>frangipane</i>, in short of the feminine
<i>petite-oie</i>. Thus, by obtaining a relic, she would kill
two birds with one stone; she would absorb the virtue
of Saint Magdalene and at the same time destroy for
ever the bad magic of that <i>petite-oie</i> of bad omen
which she had bought at the Foire St. Germain.
The very next day she would go to the Carmelites,
and perhaps, <i>perhaps</i>, if they had not long ago been
all distributed, procure a piece of the magical habit.
At any rate she would consolidate her cult for Saint
Magdalene by burning some candles in the wonderful
chapel set up in her honour in the Church of the
Carmelites.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ASCENT OF MOUNT CARMEL</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Many strange legends had gone to weave round the
Convent of the Carmelites—so long the centre of
fashionable Catholicism—an atmosphere of romantic
mystery.</p>

<p>Tradition taught that the order had been founded
on the summit of Mount Carmel by Elias himself. Its
earliest members were the mysterious Essenes, but
they were converted to Christianity by Saint Peter’s
Pentecostal sermon, and built on the mountain a
chapel to the Blessed Virgin Mary, she herself becoming
a member of their order. Her example was followed by
the Twelve Apostles, and any association with that
mysterious company of sinister semi-plastic beings,
menacing sinners with their symbolic keys and crosses,
had filled Madeleine since her childhood with a nameless
terror.</p>

<p>The Essenes and the Apostles! The Carmelites
thus preserved the Mysteries of both the Old and the
New Testaments.</p>

<p>Madeleine, as she stood at the door of their Convent,
too awe-struck to enter, felt herself on the confines
of the Holy Land—that land half geographical, half
Apocalyptical, where the Unseen was always bursting
through the ramparts of nature’s laws; where Transfigurations
and Assumptions were daily events, and
Assumptions not only of people but of cities. Had
not Jerusalem, with all its towers and palm-trees and
gardens and temples, been lifted up by the lever of
God’s finger right through the Empyrean, and landed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
intact and all burning with gold in the very centre
of the Seventh Heaven?</p>

<p>Summoning up all her courage she passed into the
court. It was quite empty, and over its dignified
proportions there did indeed seem to lie the shadow
of the silent awful Denizen of ‘high places.’ Dare
she cross it? Once more she pulled herself together
and made her way into the Church.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous place, supported by great pillars
of marble and bronze and hung with large, sombre
pictures by Guido and Philippe de Champagne, while
out of the darkness gleamed the ‘Arche d’Alliance’
with its huge sun studded with jewels.</p>

<p>The atmosphere though impressive was familiar—merely
Catholicism in its most luxuriant form, and
Madeleine took heart. She set out in quest of the
Magdalene’s Chapel. Here and there a nun was
kneeling, but she was the only stranger.</p>

<p>Yes, it was but meet that here—the grave of sweet
Mademoiselle de Vigean’s love for the great Condé
and of many another romantic tragedy—the Magdalene
should be specially honoured.</p>

<p>The Chapel was small and rich, its door of fretted
iron-work made it look not unlike a great lady’s <i>alcove</i>.
It was filled with pictures by Le Brun and his pupils
of scenes from the life of the Saint. There she was
in a dark grove, with tears of penitence streaming
from the whites of large upturned eyes. And there
she was again, beneath the Cross, and there watching
at the Tomb, but always torn by the same intensity
of pseudo emotion, for Le Brun and Guido foreshadowed
in their pictures that quality of poignant, artificial
anguish which a few years later was to move all sensibilities
in the tragedies of Racine.</p>

<p>Madeleine was much moved by the Magdalene’s
anguish, and hesitated to obtrude her own request.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
But her throbbing desire won the day, and remembering
what Berthe had said about flattery she knelt before
the largest picture and began by praising the Magdalene’s
beauty and piety and high place in Paradise, and
then with humble importunity implored the friendship
of her namesake.</p>

<p>When she opened her eyes, there was the Magdalene
as absorbed as before in the intensity of her own
emotion. Le Brun’s dramatic chiaroscuro brings
little comfort to suppliants—the eternal impassivity
of the Buddha is far less discouraging than an eternal
emotion in which we have no part.</p>

<p>Madeleine felt the chill of repulse. Perhaps in
Paradise as on earth the Saints were sensible to nothing
but the cycle of the sacred Story, and knew no emotions
but passionate grief at the Crucifixion, ecstasy at
the Resurrection, awe at the Ascension, and child-like
joy as the Birth comes round again.</p>

<p>‘I am scorned in both the worldly and the sacred
alcoves,’ she told herself bitterly, nevertheless, she
determined to continue her attentions.</p>

<p>She bought three fine candles and added them to
those already burning on the Magdalen’s altar. What
did the Saint do with the candles? Perhaps at night
when no one was looking she melted them down, then
added them to the wax of reality and moulded, moulded,
moulded. Once more Madeleine fell on her knees, and
there welled from her heart a passion of supplication.</p>

<p><i>Sainte Madeleine</i>, the patron saint of all Madeleines
... of Madeleine Troqueville and of Madeleine de
Scudéry ... the saint who had loved so much herself
... the successor of she whom Jacques had
called ‘the beneficent and bountiful Venus’ ...
surely, surely she would grant her request.</p>

<p>‘Deathless Saint Magdalen of the damasked throne,’
she muttered, ‘friend of Jesus, weaver of wiles, vex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
not my soul with frets and weariness but hearken to
my prayer. Who flees, may she pursue; who spurns
gifts may she offer them; who loves not, willy-nilly
may she love. Broider my speech with the quaint
flowers of Paradise, on thine own loom weave me
wiles and graces to the ensnaring of my love. Up the
path of Admiration lead Sappho to my desire.’</p>

<p>She felt a touch on her shoulder, and, looking round,
saw a lay-sister, in the brown habit of the Carmelites.
Her twinkling black eyes reminded Madeleine of
another pair of eyes, but whose she could not remember.</p>

<p>‘I ask pardon, Madame,’ the sister said in a low
voice, ‘but we hold ourselves the hostesses, as it were,
of all wanderers on Carmel. Is there aught that I
can do for you?’</p>

<p>Madeleine’s heart began to beat wildly; the suddenness
with which an opportunity had been given her
for procuring her wish seemed to her of the nature of
a miracle. Through her perennial grief at the old,
old story, the Magdalene must have heard her prayer.
A certainty was born in on her that her desire would
be granted. She and the other Madeleine would one
day visit the Chapel together, and side by side set up
rows and rows of wax candles in gratitude for the
perfection of their friendship.</p>

<p>‘Oh, sister, I am much beholden to you,’ she stammered.
The nun led the way out of the Church into
the great garden that marched with that of the
Luxembourg and rivalled it in magnificence. She
sat down by a statue of the Virgin, enamelled in gold
and azure.</p>

<p>Madeleine thought with contemptuous pity of the
comparatively meagre dimensions and furnishing of
Port-Royal, and triumphed to think how far she had
wandered from Jansenism.</p>

<p>‘You have the air of one in trouble,’ said the nun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
kindly. Her breath smelt of onions, and somehow or
other this broke the spell of the situation for Madeleine.
It was a touch of realism not suited to a mystical
messenger.</p>

<p>‘I perceive graven on your countenance the lines
of sorrow, my child,’ she went on, ‘but to everything
exists its holy pattern, and these lines can also be
regarded as a blessing, when we call to mind the holy
stigmata.’ She gabbled off this speech as though it
had been part of the patter of a quack.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I am exceeding unhappy,’ said Madeleine;
‘at least I am oppressed by fears as to the issue of
certain matters,’ she corrected herself, for ‘unhappy’
seemed a word of ill-omen.</p>

<p>‘Poor child!’ said the Sister, ‘but who knows but
that oil and balm of comfort may not pour on you
from Mount Carmel?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, do you think it may?’ Madeleine cried eagerly.</p>

<p>‘’Tis a strange thing, but many go away from here
comforted. It is richly blessed.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder,’ Madeleine began hesitatingly. ‘I fear
’tis asking too much—but if I could but have a relic
of the blessed Mère Madeleine de Saint-Joseph! The
world reports her relics more potent than any other
Saint’s.’ (In spite of the efforts of many great French
ladies, Mère Madeleine de Saint-Joseph had <i>not</i> been
canonised. Madeleine knew this, but she thought
she would please the Carmelite by ignoring it.)</p>

<p>At Madeleine’s words the little nun wriggled her
body into a succession of Gallic contortions, in which
eyebrows and hands played a large part, expressive
of surprise, horror, and complete inability to grant
such an outrageous request. But Madeleine pleaded
hard, and after a dissertation on the extraordinary
virtue of the habit, and a repeated reiteration that
there were only one or two scraps of it left, the Carmelite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
finally promised that one of these scraps should be
Madeleine’s.</p>

<p>She went into the Convent and came back with a
tiny piece of frayed cloth, and muttering a prayer
she fixed it inside Madeleine’s bodice.</p>

<p>Madeleine was almost too grateful to say ‘thank you.’</p>

<p>‘All the greatest ladies of the Court and the Town
are wont to wear a portion of the sacred habit,’ the
nun continued complacently. Madeleine found herself
wondering quite seriously if the mère Madeleine
de Saint-Joseph had been a <i>Gargamelle</i> in proportions.</p>

<p>‘To speak truth, it must have been a huge and
capacious garment!’ she said in all good faith. The
nun gave her a quick look out of her shrewd little
eyes, but ignored the remark.</p>

<p>‘And now Mademoiselle will give us a contribution for
our Order, will she not?’ she said insinuatingly. Madeleine
was much taken aback. She blushed and said,—</p>

<p>‘Oh, in earnest ... ’tis accordant with my wishes
... but ... er ... how much?’</p>

<p>‘Do but consult your own heart, and it will go hard
but we shall be satisfied. I have given you what to
the eyes of the flesh appears but a sorry scrap of poor
rough fustian, but to the eyes of the spirit it has the
lustre of velvet, and there is not a Duchess but would
be proud to wear it!’</p>

<p>Why, of course, her eyes were like those of the mercer
at the Fair who had sold her the ‘<i>petite-oie</i>’!</p>

<p>However, one acquires merit by giving to holy
Houses ... and also, Mademoiselle has procured
something priceless beyond rubies. Madeleine offered
a gold louis, and the nun was profuse in her thanks. They
parted at the great gates, the nun full of assurances as to
the efficacy of the amulet, Madeleine of grateful thanks.</p>

<p>It had been a strange adventure, and she left the
Sacred Mountain with conflicting emotions.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BODY OF THE DRAGON</span></h3>

</div>

<p>If you remember, when Madeleine had realised that
the feast of Saint Magdalene was approaching, an idea
had flashed into her head which she had not then
dared to entertain. But it had slowly crept back and
now had established itself as a fixed purpose. It was
this—on the feast of Saint Magdalene to communicate,
<i>without having first received Absolution</i>. She felt that
it would please the potent Saint that she should commit
a deadly sin in her honour. Also, it would mean a
complete and final rupture with Jansenism. And
with one stroke she would annihilate her Salvation—that
predestined ghostly certainty to the fulfilment
of which the Celestial Powers seemed bent on sacrificing
all her worldly hopes and happiness. Yes, she would now
be able to walk in security along the familiar paths
of life, unhaunted by the fear of the sudden whirr of
wings and then—the rape to the love of invisible
things.</p>

<p>So on Sunday, the twenty-second of July, she partook
of the Blessed Sacrament. Arnauld had written in
the ‘Fréquente Communion’: ‘<i>therefore as the true
penitent eats the body of Jesus Christ, so the sinner eats
the body of the Dragon</i>.’</p>

<p>Well, and so she was eating the body of the Dragon!
The knowledge gave her a strange sense of exaltation
and an awful peace.</p>

</div>

<p>It was the day before the meeting. Early next morning
the Chevalier de Méré was to call for her in his coach
and drive her out to Conrart’s house. He was also
taking that tiresome little Mademoiselle Boquet.
That was a pity, but she was particularly pleased
that the Chevalier himself was to be there, he always
brought out her most brilliant qualities.</p>

<p><i>She was absolutely certain of success</i> ... the real
world seemed to have become the dream world ...
she felt as if she had been turned into a creature of
some light, unsubstantial substance living in an airless
crystal ball.</p>

<p>That afternoon, being Thursday and a holiday,
she went an excursion with Jacques to Chaillot, a
little village up the Seine. She walked in a happy
trance, and the fifteenth century Church, ornate and
frivolous, dotted with its black Minims—‘<i>les bons
hommes de Chaillot</i>’—and the coach of the exiled
Queen-Mother of England’s gaily rattling down the
cobbled street, seemed to her—safe inside her crystal
ball—pretty and unreal and far-away, like Berthe’s
stories of Lorraine.</p>

<p>Then they wandered into a little copse behind the
village and lay there in the fantastic green shade, and
Madeleine stroked and petted Jacques and laughed
away his jealousy about the Chevalier, and promised
that next week she would go with him to the notary
and plight her troth.</p>

<p>Then they got up and she took his arm; on her face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
was a rapt smile, for she was dreaming particularly
pleasant things about herself and Sappho.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jacques’s foot caught in a hidden root
... down he came, dragging Madeleine after him
... smash went the crystal ball, and once more she
saw the world bright and hard and menacing and felt
around her the rough, shrewd winds.</p>

<p>So Jacques had made her fall—just when she was
having such pleasant dreams of Sappho!</p>

<p><i>Hylas, hélas! Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes. Birds
thinking to fly through have dashed themselves against
the wall. ’Tis as though the issue of his roman were tied
in a strange knot with that of yours. I have been writing

tarry to smash your fragile world into a thousand fragments</i>
... weapons? Perhaps one of them was
‘the scimitar of the Comic Muse’ (or was it the
‘symmetry’? It did not really matter which.)</p>

<p>Who was the mercer at the Fair? He had the same
eyes as the nun at the Carmelites.... Her father,
too, had a <i>petite-oie</i> ... he had put his faith in bravery.
Perhaps Venus-Magdalen and the Comic Muse were

you, as he has done to me! A comedy written upon
life instead of upon foolscap.</i></p>

<p>In morbid moments she had often heard a whisper
to which she had never permitted herself to listen.
She heard the whisper now, louder and more insistent
than ever before. To-day she could not choose but
listen to it.</p>

<p><i>Her ‘roman’ had to follow the pattern of her father’s.
Her father’s ‘roman,’ as slowly it unfolded, was nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
but a magical pre-doing of her own future, more potent
than her dances. And God had deputed the making of
it to—Jacques. He was the playwright, or the engraver,
or the moulder of wax—it mattered little in what medium
he wrought his sinister art.</i></p>

<p>There was still time to act. ‘She would <i>do</i>, she would
<i>do</i>, she would <i>do</i>.’ Action is the only relief for a hag-ridden
brain. An action that was ruthless and final—that
would break his power and rid her of him for
ever. That action should be consummated.</p>

<p>All the while that this train of fears and memories
had been coursing through her brain, she had chattered
to Jacques with hectic gaiety.</p>

<p>When they got home she ran to the kitchen to find
Berthe.</p>

<p>‘Berthe, were you ever of opinion I would wed with
Monsieur Jacques?’</p>

<p>Berthe leered and winked. ‘Well, Mademoiselle,’
she said, ‘Love is one thing—marriage is another.
Monsieur Jacques could not give Mademoiselle a coach
and a fine <i>hôtel</i> in the Rue de Richelieu. I understand
Mademoiselle exceeding well, in that we are not
unlike in some matters,’ and she gave her grotesque
grin. ‘As for me, I would never wed with a man
except he could raise me to a better condition than
mine own—else what would it profit one? But if some
plump little tradesman were to come along——’</p>

<p>‘But did you hold that I would wed with Monsieur
Jacques?’ Madeleine persisted.</p>

<p>‘Well, if Mademoiselle <i>did</i> wed with him, she would
doubtless be setting too low a price on herself, though
he is a fine young gentleman and <i>malin comme un singe</i>;
he is like Albert, nothing escapes him.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think the Saints like us to use each other
unkindly?’</p>

<p>Berthe laughed enigmatically, ‘I think ’tis a matter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
of indifference to them, so long as they get the
<i>sous</i>.’</p>

<p>‘But don’t you think it might accord well with their
humour if they are as wicked as you say they are?’</p>

<p>Part of the truth suddenly flashed on Berthe, and
she winked and chuckled violently. ‘Oh, Mademoiselle
is sly!’ she cried admiringly. ‘I think it would please
them not a little were Mademoiselle to jilt a poor man
that she might wed with a rich one, for then there
would be gold for them instead of copper!’</p>

<p>And Madeleine, having forced her oracle into giving
her a more or less satisfactory answer, fled from the
room in dread of Berthe mentioning the name of the
Chevalier de Méré and thereby spoiling the oracular
answer.</p>

<p>She called Jacques to her room at once, and found
herself—she who had such a horror of hurting the
feelings of her neighbours that she would let a thief
cut her purse-strings rather than that he should know
that she knew he was a thief—telling him without a
tremor that his personality was obnoxious to her,
his addresses still more so, and that she wanted
to end their relationship once and for all. Jacques
listened in perfect silence. At her first words he had
gone white and then flushed the angry red of wounded
vanity, and then once more had turned white. When
she had finished, he said in a voice of icy coldness,—</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle, you have an admirable clearness
of exposition; rest assured I shall not again annoy
you with my addresses—or my presence,’ and with
his head very high he left the room.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE END OF THE ‘ROMAN’</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Madeleine listened to Jacques’s light footsteps going
down the long flight of stairs, and knew that he had
gone for ever. With this knowledge came a sense of
peace she had not known for days, and one of sacramental
purity, such as must have filled the souls of
pious Athenians when at the Thargelia the <i>Pharmakoi</i>
were expelled from the city.</p>

<p>Yes, just in time she had discovered the true moral
of the Sapphic Ode and the story of Nausicaa, to wit,
that the gods will break their promises if man fails
to perform the necessary rites and ceremonies. Ritually,
her affairs were in exquisite order. By her sacrilegious
Communion (she still shuddered at the thought of it)
she had consolidated her cult for the powerful Saint
Magdalene, and at the same time cut out of her heart
the brand of God, by which in the fullness of time the
ravishing Angel would have discovered his victim.
And, finally, by her dismissal of Jacques, she had rid
herself of a most malign miasma. The wax of reality
lay before her, smooth and white and ready for her
moulding. All she had to do now was to sparkle, and,
automatically, she would arouse the passion of
Admiration.</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered another loose thread
that needed to be gathered up. The <i>roman</i> of her
dances had not been brought to a climax.</p>

<p>An unwritten law of the style gallant makes the
action of a <i>roman</i> automatically cease after a declaration
of love. Nothing can happen afterwards. What if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
she should force time to its fullness and make a declaration?
It would be burning her boats, it would be
staking all her happiness on this last meeting, for if
it were a failure hope would be dead. For, owing to
her strange confusion of the happenings of her dances
with those of real life, the <i>roman</i> of the one having
been completed, its magical virtue all used up, its
colophon reached, she felt that the <i>roman</i> of the other
would also have reached its colophon, that nothing
more could happen. But for great issues she must
take great risks ... <i>dansons</i>!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Sappho and Madeleine are reclining on a bank, the
colour and design of which rival all the carpets in the
bazaars of Bagdad. There is no third person to mar their
ravishing solitude <span class="antiqua">à deux</span>. Madeleine is saying,</i>—</p>

<p><i>‘I must confess, Madame, that your delicious writings
have made me a heretic.’</i></p>

<p><i>Sappho laughs gaily. ‘Then I tremble for your fate,
for heretics are burned.’</i></p>

<p><i>‘In that case I am indeed a heretic, for a flame has
long burned me,’ says Madeleine boldly. But Sappho
possesses in a high degree the art of hearing only what she
chooses, and she says, a trifle coldly</i>,—</p>

<p><i>‘If my writings have made you a heretic, they must
themselves be heretical. Do they contain Five Propositions
worthy of papal condemnation?’</i></p>

<p><i>‘Madame, you are resolved to misunderstand me.
They have made me a heretic in regard to the verdict of
posterity as to the merits of the ancients, for since I have
steeped myself, if I may use the expression, in your
incomparable style I have become as deaf as Odysseus
to the siren songs of Greece and Rome.’</i></p>

<p><i>‘That is indeed heresy,’ cries Sappho with a smile that
shows she is not ill-pleased. ‘I fear it will be visited by
excommunication by the whole College of Muses.’</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p><i>‘The only punishment of heresy—you have yourself
said so—is ... flame,’ says Madeleine, gazing straight
into the eyes of Sappho. This time she is almost certain
she can perceive a blush on that admirable person’s cheek—<span class="antiqua">almost</span>
certain, for the expression of such delicate things
as the Passions of Sappho must need itself be very delicate.
Descartes has said that a blush proceeds from one of
two passions—love or hate. <span class="antiqua">En voilà un problème
galant!</span></i></p>

<p><i>‘To justify my heresy, permit me, Madame, to recall
to your mind a poem by your namesake, the Grecian
Sappho,</i>—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘That man seems to me greater than the gods who doth
sit facing thee and sees thee and hears thy delicate laughter.
When this befalls me my senses clean depart ... all is
void ... my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth,
drop by drop flame steals down my slender veins ...
there is a singing in mine ears ... my eyes are covered
with a twin night.</p>

</div>

<p><i>She pauses, but Sappho laughs—perhaps not <span class="antiqua">quite</span>
naturally—and cries,</i>—</p>

<p><i>‘Mademoiselle, your heresy still stands unjustified!’</i></p>

<p><i>‘Why, Madame, how could any one of taste take pleasure
in verse so devoid of wit, of grace, of <span class="antiqua">galanterie</span> ... so
bare, so barbarous, after they have been initiated into the
Parnassian Mysteries of <span class="antiqua">your</span> incomparable verse and
prose? Why, what I have quoted is the language of
lexicographers and philosophers, not the divine cadences
of a poet. Put in metre Descartes’ description of the
signs by which the movements of the Passions may be
detected, namely,</i>—</p>

<p><i>‘“The chief signs by which the Passions show themselves
are the motions of the eyes and the face, changes of
colour, trembling, languor, faintness, laughter, tears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
moans, and sighs,” and you will have a poem every whit
as graceful and well-turned!</i></p>

<p><i>‘The poem of Sappho I. is a “small thing” ... but
if it had proceeded from the delicious pen of Sappho II.
it would have been a “rose”!’</i></p>

<p><i>‘And how should I have effected this miracle?’ asks
Sappho with a smile.</i></p>

<p><i>‘I think, Madame, you would have used that excellent
device of the Muse Galante which I will call that of
Eros Masqué.’</i></p>

<p><i>‘Eros Masqué? Is he unseen then as well as unseeing?’</i></p>

<p><i>‘On his first visit, frequently, Madame. And this
droll fact—that lovers pierced by as many of his arrows
as Saint Sebastian by those of the Jews are wont to ignore
the instrument by which they have got their wounds—has
been put to pretty use by many <span class="antiqua">poètes galants</span>. For
example, an amorous maiden or swain doth describe
divers well-known effects of the tender passion, and then
asks with a delicious naïveté, “Can it be Love?” And
this simple little question, if inserted between each of the
symptoms enumerated by Sappho, would go far to giving
her poem the <span class="antiqua">esprit</span> it so sadly lacks. But, Madame,
far the most ravishing of all the poems of Eros Masqué
are your own incomparable verses in the sixth volume
of “Cyrus”</i>:—</p>

<p><i>‘These delicious verses of the gentle Tristan might have
been a description of the land of <span class="antiqua">l’Amitié Tendre</span>, so
charmed is its atmosphere, so deep its green shadows,
so heavy its brooding peace. For all round it is traced
a magic circle across which nothing discordant or
vulgar can venture.... Without, moan the Passions
like wild beasts enchained, the thunder booms, the lightning
flashes, and there is a heap as high as a mountain of
barbed arrows shot by Love, all of which have fallen short
of that magic circle.</i></p>

<p><i>‘Happy they who have crossed it!</i></p>

<p><i>‘Madame, I called the Grecian Sappho a barbarian....
Barbarian or no she discovered hundreds of years
ago the charm by which the magic circle can be crossed
... the charm is simple when you know it; it is merely
this ... take another maiden with you. It has never
been crossed by man and maid, for in sight of the country’s
cool trees and with the murmur of its fountains in their
ear they have been snatched from behind by one of the
enchained passions, or grievously wounded by one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
the whizzing arrows ... Madame, shall we try the
virtue of the Grecian Sappho’s charm?’</i></p>

<p><i>And Sappho murmurs ‘yes.’</i></p>

</div>

<p>The next morning—the morning of <i>the</i> day—Madeleine
woke up with the same feeling of purification; she
seemed to be holding the day’s culmination in her
hands, and it was made of solid white marble, that
cooled her palms as she held it.</p>

<p>Berthe, with mysterious winks, brought her a sealed
letter. It was from Jacques:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Chop</span>,—I am moving to the lodgings of a friend
for a few days, and then I go off to join the Army in Spain.
Take no blame to yourself for this, for I have always
desired strangely to travel and have my share in manly
adventures, and would, ’tis likely, have gone anyhow.
I would never have made a good Procureur. I have
written to Aunt Marie to acquaint her with my sudden
decision, in such manner that she cannot suspect what
has really taken place.</p>

<p>‘Oh, dear! I had meant to rail against you and I think
this is nothing toward it! ’Tis a strange and provoking
thing that one cannot—try as one will—be moved by
<i>real</i> anger towards those one cares about! Not that I
have any real cause to be angry upon your score—bear
in mind, Chop, that I know this full well—but in spite
of this I would dearly like to be!</p>

<p class="right">‘<span class="smcap">Jacques.</span>’</p>

</div>

<p>As she read it, she realised that she had made a big
sacrifice. Surely it would be rewarded!</p>

<p>She dressed in a sort of trance. Her excitement
was so overwhelming, so vibrantly acute, that she
was almost unconscious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>Then the Chevalier, with little Mademoiselle Boquet,
drove up to the door, and Madeleine got in, smiling
vaguely in reply to the Chevalier’s compliments, and
they drove off, her mother and Berthe standing waving
at the door. On rolled the <i>carrosse</i> past La Porte
Sainte-Antoine, through which were pouring carts full
of vegetables and fruit for the Halles, and out into the
white road beyond; and on rolled the smooth cadences
of the Chevalier’s voice—‘To my mind the highest
proof that one is possessed of wit and that one knows
how to wield it, is to lead a well-ordered life and to
behave always in society in a seemly fashion. And
to do that consists in all circumstances following the
most <i>honnête</i> line and that which seems most in keeping
with the condition of life to which one belongs. Some
rôles in life are more advantageous than others; it is
Fortune that casts them and we cannot choose the
one we wish; but whatever that rôle may be, one
is a good actor if one plays it well ...’ and so on.
Fortunately, sympathetic monosyllables were all that
the Chevalier demanded from his audience, and these
he got from Mademoiselle Boquet and Madeleine.</p>

<p>And so the journey went on, and at last they were
drawing up before a small, comfortable white house
with neatly-clipped hedges, shrubberies, and the
play of a sedate fountain. Madame Conrart, kind
and flustered, was at the door to meet them, and led
them into a large room in which Conrart in an arm-chair
and Mademoiselle de Scudéry busy with her
embroidery in another arm-chair sat chatting together.
Conrart’s greeting to Madeleine was kindness itself,
and Mademoiselle de Scudéry also said something
polite and friendly. She pretended not to hear her,
and moved towards Madame Conrart, for as soon as
her eyes had caught sight of Sappho, she had been
seized by the same terrible self-consciousness, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
same feeling of ‘nothing matters so long as I am
seen and heard as little as may be.’</p>

<p>Then came some twenty minutes of respite, for
Mademoiselle Boquet with her budget of news of the
Court and the Town acted as a rampart between
Madeleine and Mademoiselle de Scudéry. But at
dinner-time her terror once more returned, for general
conversation was expected at meals. ‘Simple country
fare,’ said Conrart modestly, but although the dishes
were not numerous, and consisted mainly of home-reared
poultry, there were forced peaches and grapes
and the table was fragrant with flowers.</p>

<p>‘Flora and Pomona joining hands have never had
a fairer temple than this table,’ said the Chevalier,
and all the company, save Madeleine, added their
tribute to their host’s bounty. But Madeleine sat
awkward and tongue-tied, too nervous to eat. The
precious moments of her last chance were slipping
by; even if she thought of a thousand witty things
she would not be able to say them, for her tongue
felt swollen and impotent. Descartes on the Will
was just an old pedant, talking of what he did not
understand.</p>

<p>At last dinner was over, and Conrart suggested they
should go for a little walk in the grounds. He offered
his arm to Mademoiselle de Scudéry, the Chevalier
followed with Madame Conrart, so Madeleine and
Mademoiselle Boquet found themselves partners. But
even then Madeleine was at first unable to break the
spell of heavy silence hanging over her. ‘Blessed
Saint Magdalene, help me! help me! help me!’ she
muttered, and then reminded herself that being neither
half-witted nor dumb, it did not demand any gigantic
effort of will to <i>force</i> herself to behave like an <i>honnête
femme</i> ... and to-day it was a matter of life or
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>She felt like a naked, shivering creature, standing
at the top of a gigantic rock, and miles below her lay
an icy black pool, but she must take the plunge; and
she did.</p>

<p>She began to reinforce her self-confidence by being
affected and pretentious with Mademoiselle Boquet,
but the little lady’s gentle reserve made her vaguely
uncomfortable. She was evidently one of those annoying
little nonentities with strong likes and dislikes, and a
whole bundle of sharp little judgments of their own, who
are always vaguely irritating to their more triumphant
sisters. Then she tried hard to realise <i>emotionally</i>
that the gray female back in front of her belonged to
Mademoiselle de Scudéry—to the <i>Reine de Tendre</i>;
to Sappho—but somehow her imagination was
inadequate. The focus of all her tenderness was not
this complacent lady, but the Sappho of her dances.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As, for example, I find in myself two divers Ideas of
the Sun, one as received by my senses by which it appears
to me very small, another as taken from the arguments
of Astronomers by which ’tis rendered something bigger
than the Globe of the Earth. Certainly both of these
cannot be like that sun which is without me, and my
reason persuades that that Idea is most unlike the Sun,
which seems to proceed immediately from itself.</p>

</div>

<p>She remembered these words of Descartes’ Third
Meditation ... two suns and two Sapphos, and the
one perceived by the senses, not the real one ... and
yet, and yet she could <i>never</i> be satisfied with merely
the Sappho of the dances, even though metaphysically
she were more real than the other. Her happiness
depended in merging the two Sapphos into one ...
she must remember, reality is colourless and silent and
malleable ... a white, still Sappho like the Grecian
statues in the Louvre ... to the Sappho of her dances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
she gave what qualities she chose, so could she to the
Sappho who was walking a few paces in front of her
... forward la Madeleine! Then the Chevalier came
and walked on her other side. She told herself that
this was a good opportunity of working herself into
a vivacious mood, which would bridge over the next
awful chasm. So she burst into hectic persiflage, and
to Hell with Mademoiselle Boquet’s little enigmatical
smile!</p>

<p>They were walking in a little wood. Suddenly from
somewhere among the trees came the sound of violins.
A <i>cadeau</i> for one of the ladies! Madeleine felt that
she would die with embarrassment if it were not for
her—yes, <i>die</i>—humiliated for ever in the eyes of Mademoiselle
de Scudéry, in relationship to whom she
always pictured herself as a triumphant beauty, with
every inch of the stage to herself.</p>

<p>There was a little buzz of expectation among the
ladies, and Madame Conrart, looking flustered and
pleased, said: ‘I am sure it is none of our doing.’
Madeleine stretched her lips in a forced smile, in a
fever of anxiety.</p>

<p>Then suddenly they came to an open clearing in
the wood, and there was a table heaped with preserved
fruits and jams and sweetmeats and liqueurs, all of
them rose-coloured. The napkins were of rose-coloured
silk and folded into the shape of hearts, the knives
were tiny darts of silver. Behind stood the four fiddlers
scratching away merrily at a <i>pot pourré</i> of airs from
the latest <i>ballet de cour.</i> The ladies gave little ‘ohs!’
of delight, and Conrart looked pleased and important,
but that did not mean anything, for he was continually
taking a possessive pride in matters in which he had
had no finger. The Chevalier looked enigmatic. Conrart
turned to him with a knowing look and said,—</p>

<p>‘Chevalier, you are a professor of the <i>philosophie de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
galanterie</i>, can you tell us whether rose pink is the
colour of <i>Estime</i> or of <i>le Tendre</i>?’</p>

<p>‘Descartes is dumb on the relation of colours to the
Passions, so it is not for me to decide,’ the Chevalier
answered calmly, ‘all <i>I</i> know is that the Grecian rose
was pink.’ Madeleine’s heart gave a bound of
triumph.</p>

<p>The fiddles started a languorous saraband, and from
the trees a shower of artificial rose-petals fell on the
ladies. Mademoiselle de Scudéry looked very gracious.</p>

<p>‘Our unknown benefactor has a very fragrant invention,’
she said in a tone which seemed to Madeleine
to intimate that <i>she</i> was the queen of the occasion.
Vain, foolish, ugly creature, how dare she think so,
when she, Madeleine, was there! Had she not heard
what the Chevalier had said about the ‘Grecian rose’?—(though
why she should know that the Chevalier
called Madeleine ‘Rhodanthos,’ I fail to perceive!)—she
would put her in her place. She gave a little
affected laugh, and, looking straight at the Chevalier,
she said,—</p>

<p>‘It is furiously gallant. I thank you a thousand
times.’</p>

<p>The Chevalier looked nonplussed, and stammered
out that ‘Cupid must have known that a bevy of
Belles had planned to visit that wood.’</p>

<p>Madeleine had committed the unpardonable crime—she
had openly acknowledged a <i>cadeau</i>, whereas
<i>Galanterie</i> demanded that the particular lady it was
intended to honour should be veiled in a piquant
mystery. Why, it was enough to send all the ladies of
<i>Cyrus</i> shuddering back for ever to their Persian
seraglios! But she had as well broken the spell of
silence woven by Mademoiselle de Scudéry’s presence.
That lady exchanged a little look with Mademoiselle
Boquet which somehow glinted right off from Madeleine’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
shining new armour. She gulped off a liqueur and gave
herself tooth and nail to the business of shining. She
began to flirt outrageously with the Chevalier, and
though he quite enjoyed it, the <i>pédagogue galant</i> in
him made a mental note to give Madeleine a hint
that this excessive <i>galanterie</i> smacked of the previous
reign, while the present fashion was a witty prudishness.
Certainly, Mademoiselle de Scudéry was not looking
impressed, but, somehow, Madeleine did not care;
the one thing that mattered was that she should be
brilliantly in the foreground, and be very witty, and
then Mademoiselle de Scudéry <i>must</i> admire her.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scudéry soon started a quiet little
chat with Conrart, which caused Madeleine’s vivacity to
flag; how could she sparkle when her sun was
hidden?</p>

<p>‘Yes, <i>la belle Indienne</i> would doubtless have found
her native America less barbarous than the <i>milieu</i> in
which she has been placed by an exceeding ironical
fortune,’ Mademoiselle de Scudéry was saying. Madeleine,
deeply read in <i>La Gazette Burlesque</i>, knew that
she was speaking of the beautiful and ultra-refined
Madame Scarron, forced to be hostess of the most
licentious <i>salon</i> in Paris.</p>

<p>‘’Tis my opinion she falls far short of Monsieur
Scarron in learning, wit, and galanterie!’ burst in
Madeleine. She did not think so really; it was just
a desire to make herself felt. Mademoiselle de Scudéry
raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>‘Is Mademoiselle acquainted with Madame Scarron?’
she inquired in a voice that implied she was certain
that she was not. In ordinary circumstances, such a
snub, even from some one for whose good opinion
she did not care a rap, would have reduced her to
complete silence, but to-day she seemed to have risen
invulnerable from the Styx.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>‘No, I haven’t been presented to her—although
I have seen her,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘And yet you speak of her as though you had much
frequented her? You put me in mind, Mademoiselle,
of the troupe of players in my brother’s comedy who
called themselves <i>Comédiens du Roi</i>, although they
had played before His Majesty but once,’ said Mademoiselle
de Scudéry coldly.</p>

<p>‘In earnest, I have no wish to pass as Madame
Scarron’s comedian. Rumour has it she was born
in a prison,’ Madeleine rejoined insolently. ‘Moreover,
I gather from her friends, the only merit in her prudishness
is that it acts as a foil to her husband’s wit.’</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Scudéry merely raised her eyebrows,
and Conrart, attempting to make things more
comfortable, said with a good-natured smile,—</p>

<p>‘Ah! Sappho, the young people have their own
ideas about things, I dare swear, and take pleasure in
the <i>genre burlesque</i>!’</p>

<p>(Jacques would have smiled to hear Madeleine
turned into the champion of the burlesque!) ‘Well, all
said, the burlesque, were it to go to our friend Ménage
(whom one might call the Hozier<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of literary forms)
might get a fine family tree for itself, going back to
the Grecian Aristophanes—is that not so, Chevalier?’
went on Conrart. The Chevalier smiled non-committally.</p>

<p>‘No, no,’ interrupted Madeleine; ‘certainly not
Aristophanes. I should say that the Grecian Anthology
is the founder of the family; a highly respectable
ancestor, though <i>de robe</i> rather than <i>d’épée</i>, for I am
told Alexandrian Greek is not as noble as that of
Athens. It contains several epigrams, quite in the
manner of Saint-Amant.’ She was quoting Jacques,
from whom, without knowing a word of Greek, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
had gleaned certain facts about Greek construction
and literature.</p>

<p>Though Conrart never tried to conceal his ignorance
of Greek, he could scarcely relish a reminder of it, while
to be flatly contradicted by a fair damsel was not in
his Chinese picture of Ladies and Sages. Mademoiselle
de Scudéry came to his rescue,—</p>

<p>‘For myself, I have always held that all an <i>honnête
homme</i> need know is Italian and Spanish’—(here she
smiled at Conrart, who was noted for his finished knowledge
of these two tongues)—‘the nature of the passions,
<i>l’usage de monde</i>, and above all, Mythology, but that
can be studied in a translation quite as well as in the
original Greek or Latin. This is the <i>necessary</i> knowledge
for an <i>honnête homme</i>, but as the word <i>honnête</i> covers
a quantity of agreeable qualities, such as a swift imagination,
an exquisite judgment, an excellent memory,
and a lively humour naturally inclined to learning
about everything it sees that is curious and that it
hears mentioned as worthy of praise, the possessor of
these qualities will naturally add a further store of
agreeable information to the accomplishments I have
already mentioned. These accomplishments are necessary
also to an <i>honnête femme</i>, but as well as being able to
<i>speak</i> Italian and Spanish, she must be able to <i>write</i>
her native French; I must confess that the orthography
of various distinguished ladies of my acquaintance
is barely decent! As well as knowing the nature
and movements of the Passions she must know the
causes and effects of maladies, and a quantity of
receipts for the making of medicaments and perfumes
and cordials ... in fact of both useful and gallant
distillations, as necessity or pleasure may demand.
As well as being versed in Mythology, that is to say,
in the <i>amours</i> and exploits of ancient gods and heroes,
she must know what I will call the modern Mythology,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
that is to say the doings of her King and the <i>historiettes</i>
of the various Belles and Gallants of the Court and
Town.’</p>

<p>All the company had sat in rapt attention during
this discourse, except Madeleine, who had fidgeted
and wriggled and several times had attempted to break
in with some remark of her own. Now she took
advantage of the slight pause that followed to cry
out aggressively: ‘Italian and Spanish <i>may</i> be the
language of <i>les honnêtes gens</i>, but Greek is certainly
that of <i>les gens gallants</i>, if only for this reason, that it
alone possesses the lover’s Mood.’ Madeleine waited to
be asked what that was, and the faithful Chevalier
came to her rescue.</p>

<p>‘And what may the lover’s mood be, Mademoiselle?’
he asked with a smile.</p>

<p>‘What they call the Optative—the Mood of wishing,’
said Madeleine. The Chevalier clapped delightedly,
and Conrart, now quite restored to good humour,
also congratulated her on the sally; but Mademoiselle
de Scudéry looked supremely bored.</p>

<p>The violins started a light, melancholy dance, and
from behind the trees ran a troop of little girls, dressed
as nymphs, and presented to each of the ladies a
bouquet, showing in its arrangement the inimitable
touch of the famous florist, La Cardeau. Madeleine’s
was the biggest. Then they got up and moved on to
a little Italian grotto, where they seated themselves on
the grass, Madame Conrart insisting that her husband
should sit on a cloak she had been carting about with
her for the purpose all the afternoon. He grumbled
a little, but sat down on it all the same.</p>

<p>‘And now will the wise Agilaste make music for us?’
he asked. All looked invitingly towards Mademoiselle
Boquet. She expressed hesitation at performing in
a garden where such formidable rivals were to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
found as Conrart’s famous linnets, but she finally
yielded to persuasion, and taking her lute, began to
play. It was exquisite. First she played some airs by
Couperin, then some pavanes by a young Italian, as yet
known only to the elect and quite daring in his modernity,
by name Lulli, and last a frail, poignant melody of
the time of Henri IV., in which, as in the little poem
of the same period praised by Alceste, ‘<i>la passion
parlait toute pure</i>.’</p>

<p>Madame Conrart listened with more emotion than
any of them, beating time with her foot, her eyes
filling with tears. When Mademoiselle Boquet laid
down her lute, she drew a deep sigh. ‘Ah! Now
that’s what <i>I</i> call agreeable!’ Conrart frowned at
her severely, but Mademoiselle de Scudéry and the
Chevalier were evidently much amused. The poor
lady, realising that she had made a <i>faux pas</i>, looked
very unhappy.</p>

<p>‘Oh! I did not mean to say ... I am sure ... I hope
you will understand!’ she said to the company, but
looking at Conrart the while.</p>

<p>‘We will understand, and indeed we would be very
dull if we failed to, that you are ever the kindest and
most hospitable of hostesses,’ said Mademoiselle de
Scudéry. Madame Conrart looked relieved and said,—</p>

<p>‘I am sure you are very obliging, Mademoiselle.’
Then she turned to Madeleine, ‘And you, Mademoiselle,
do you sing or play?’ Madeleine said in a superior
tone that she did not, and the Chevalier, invariably
adequate, said: ‘Mademoiselle is a <i>merciful</i> Siren.’</p>

<p>And so the afternoon passed, until it was time to
take their leave. The Conrarts were very kind and
friendly and hoped Madeleine would come again, but
Mademoiselle de Scudéry had so many messages to
send by Mademoiselle Boquet to friends in Paris, that
she forgot even to say good-bye to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>On the drive home the Chevalier and Mademoiselle
Boquet had a learned discussion about music, and
Madeleine sat silent and wide-eyed. It was eight
o’clock when they reached the petite rue du Paon.
Madeleine rushed in to her mother, who was waiting
for her, and launched into a long excited account of
the day’s doings, which fulfilled the same psychological
need that a dance would have done, and then she went
to her room, for her mother wished to discuss the
violent decision come to so suddenly by Jacques.</p>

<p>She went straight to bed and fell asleep to the cry
of the <i>Oublieux</i>—‘La joie! la joie! Voilà des oublies!’</p>

<span class="smaller">FACE TO FACE WITH FACTS</span></h3>

</div>

<p>She awoke next morning to the sense that she must
make up her account. How exactly did things stand?
She certainly had been neither <i>gauche</i> nor silent the
day before. Saint Magdalene had done all she had
asked of her, but by so doing had she played her some
hideous trick?</p>

<p>She had had absolute faith in Descartes’ doctrine
that love proceeds from admiration, and that admiration
is caused by anything rare and extraordinary. She
<i>was</i> rare, she <i>was</i> extraordinary, but had she aroused
admiration? And even if she had, could it not be the
forerunner of hate as well as of love?</p>

<p>Alas! how much easier would be self-knowledge,
and hence, if the Greeks were right, how much easier
too would be virtue, if the actions of our passions were
as consistent, the laws that govern them as mechanical,
as they appear in Descartes’ Treatise. Moreover, how
much easier would be happiness if, docile and catholic
like birds and flowers, we were never visited by these
swift, exclusive passions, which are so rarely reciprocal.</p>

<p>No, if Mademoiselle de Scudéry did not feel for her
<i>d’un aveugle penchant le charme imperceptible</i>, the
Cestus of Venus itself would be of no avail. Even if
she had not cut herself off from the relief of her dances
by bringing them to a climax beyond which their
virtue could not function, this had been, even for their
opiate, too stern and dolorous a fact.</p>

<p>Circumstances had forced her bang up against reality
this time. She must find out, once and for all, how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
matters stood, that is to say, if she had aroused the
emotion of admiration. She must have her own
suspicions allayed—or confirmed. The only way this
could be done, was to go to the Chevalier’s house and
ask him. The spoken word carried for her always
a strange finality. Suspense would be unbearable;
she must go <i>now</i>.</p>

<p>She dressed hurriedly, slipped on her mask and
cloak, and stole into the street. The strange antiphony
of the hawkers rang through the morning, and there
echoed after her as she ran the well-known cry: <i>Vous
désirez quelque ch-o-o-se?</i> This cry in the morning,
and in the evening that of the <i>Oublieux</i>.—<i>La joie!
la joie! Voilà des oublies!</i> ... Did one answer the
other in some strange way, these morning and evening
cries? It could be turned into a dialogue between
Fate and a mortal, thus:—</p>

<p><i>Fate</i>: Vous désirez quelque cho-o-o-se?</p>

<p><i>Mortal</i>: La joie! la joie!</p>

<p><i>Fate</i>: Voilà—<i>l’oubli</i>.</p>

<p>On she ran, careless of the surprise of the passers-by,
over the Pont-Neuf, already busy, and driving
its motley trade, then along the Quais on the other
side, past the Louvre, and up the Rue de Richelieu,
where the Chevalier lived. She had naturally never
been to his rooms, but she knew where they were.
She slipped in at the main doorway and up the long
stairs, her heart beating somewhere up in her throat.
She knew he lived on the second landing. She knocked
many times before the door was opened by a lackey
in a night-cap. He gaped when he first saw her, and
then grinned broadly.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle must see Monsieur? Monsieur is
abed, but Mademoiselle doubtless will not mind that!’</p>

<p>‘Tell Monsieur that Mademoiselle Troqueville <i>must</i>
see him on urgent business,’ Madeleine said severely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>The lackey grinned again, and led her through a
great bare room, surrounded by carved wooden
chests, in which, doubtless, the Chevalier kept his
innumerable suits of clothes. They served also as
beds, chairs, and tables to the Chevalier’s army of
lackeys and pages, for some were lying full length on
them snoring lustily, and others, more matinal, were
sitting on them cross-legged, and, wrapped in rugs,
were playing at that solace of the vulgar—Lasquinet.
Madeleine felt a sudden longing to be one of them,
happy, lewd, soulless creatures!</p>

<p>She was shown into an elegant little waiting-room,
full of small inlaid tables and exquisite porcelain.
The walls were hung with crayon sketches, and large
canvasses of well-known ladies by Mignard and Beaubrun.
Some of them were in allegorical postures—there
was the celebrated Précieuse, Madame de Buisson,
holding a lyre and standing before a table covered
with books and astronomical instruments ... she
was probably meant to represent a Muse ... she
was leering horribly ... was it the Comic Muse?</p>

<p>It must have been for about a quarter of an hour
that Madeleine waited, sitting rigid and expressionless.</p>

<p>At last the Chevalier arrived, fresh from his valet’s
hands, in a gorgeous Chinese dressing-gown, scented
and combed. He held out both his hands to her and
his eyes were sparkling, to Madeleine it seemed with
a sinister light, and she found herself wondering, as
she marked the dressing-gown, if he were Descartes.
Anything was possible in this Goblin-world.</p>

<p>She suddenly realised that she must find the ‘urgent
business’ that had wrenched the Chevalier from his
morning sleep. She could not very well blurt put
‘Did Mademoiselle de Scudéry like me?’ but what
<i>could</i> she say?</p>

<p>‘Dear Rhodanthos, I cursed my valet for not being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
winged when I heard it was you, and—as you see—my
impatience was too great for a jerkin! What
brings you at this hour? That you should turn to me
in your trouble, if trouble it is, is a prettier compliment
than all <i>les fleurettes</i> of all the polite Anthologies. What
has metamorphosed the Grecian rose into a French lily?’</p>

<p>Madeleine blushed, and stammered out that she did not
know. Then the Chevalier took matters into his own
hands. This behaviour might smack of the reign of
Louis XIII., but it was very delicious for all that.</p>

<p>He took her in his arms. Madeleine lay there
impassive. After all, it saved her the trouble of
finding a reason; for the one thing that was left in
this emotional ruin was the old shrinking from people
knowing how much it mattered. But as to what he
might think of her present behaviour, ’twas a matter
of no moment whatever. She held him at arm’s length
from her for a minute.</p>

<p>‘Tell me,’ she said archly, ‘did you find yesterday
a pleasant diversion?’ His cheeks were flushed, and
there was the dull drunken look in his eyes which is one
of the ways passion expresses itself in middle-aged men.
‘Come back to me!’ he muttered thickly, without
answering her question.</p>

<p>‘First tell me if you found it diverting!’ she cried
gaily, and darted to the opposite end of the room.
He rushed after her.</p>

<p>‘Don’t madden me, child,’ he muttered, and took
her in his arms again. Again Madeleine broke away
from him laughing.</p>

<p>‘I won’t come to you till—let me see—till you tell
me if I took the fancy of Mademoiselle de Scudéry.’
She was, when hard-driven, an excellent actress, and
the question tripped out, light and mocking, as if it
had just been an excuse for tormenting him. There
she stood with laughing lips and grave, wind-swept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
eyes, keeping him at bay with her upraised hand.
‘In earnest,’ she cooed tormentingly, ‘you must first
answer my question.’ For a moment, the pedagogue
broke through the lover.</p>

<p>‘Mademoiselle de Scudéry is an exquisitely correct
lady, her sense of social seemliness amounts to genius.
She could hardly approve of a hamadryad ...
Madeleine!’ and he made a dash for her. But she
ducked and turned under his outstretched arms, and
was once more at the opposite end of the room. The
flame of her wish to know began to burn up her flimsy
rôle.</p>

<p>‘I—promise you—anything—afterwards, but—pray
tell me—<i>did Mademoiselle de Scudéry make any mention
to you of me</i>?’ she panted.</p>

<p>‘’Tis no matter and she did, I....’</p>

<p>‘Tell me!’ And somehow Madeleine’s voice compelled
obedience.</p>

<p>‘What strange <i>vision</i> is this? Well, then, as
you are so desirous of knowing ... Mademoiselle
de Scudéry ... well, she is herself a lady, and as
such cannot be over sensible to the charms of her own
sex——’</p>

<p>‘Well?’</p>

<p>‘Well, do not take it ill, but also she always finds
it hard to pardon a ... well ... a ... er ... a
certain lack of decorum. I told her she erred grievously
in her judgment of you, but, it seems, you did not
take her fancy, and she maintained’—(The Chevalier
was rather glad of the opportunity of repeating the
following words, for not being <i>in propria persona</i>,
they escaped incivility and might be beneficial.) ‘She
maintained that your manners were <i>grossier</i>, your
wit <i>de province</i>, and that even if you lived to be as
old as the Sybil, “you would never be an <i>honnête
femme</i>”.... Maintenant, ma petite Reine——’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>But Madeleine was out of the room—pushing her
way through the lackeys ... then down the staircase
... then out into the street ... running,
running, running.</p>

<p>Then she stood still and began to tremble from head
to foot with awful, silent laughter. Fool that she was
not to have seen it before! Why, the Sapphic Ode
was but another statement of the Law she had so
dreaded—that the spurner of love must in his turn
inevitably be spurned! <i>Who flees, she shall pursue;
who spurns gifts, she shall offer them; who loves not,
willy-nilly she shall love.</i> As the words stood, the ‘she’
did not necessarily refer to the object of Sappho’s
desire. Fool, fool, she had read as a promise what
was intended as a warning. <i>She was being punished for
spurning the love of Jacques.</i></p>

<p>What a strange irony, that just by her effort to escape
this Law she had brought down on herself the full
weight of its action! To avoid its punishment of her
<i>amour-propre</i> she had pretended to be in love with
Jacques, thereby entangling herself in a mass of contradictions,
deceit, and nervous terrors from which the
only means of extricating herself was by breaking the
law anew and spurning love. Verily, it was a fine
example of Até—the blindness sent by the gods on
those they mean to destroy.</p>

<p>Well, now the end had come, and of the many possibilities
and realities life had held for her, nothing was
left but the <i>adamant of desire which neither the tools of
earth can break, nor the chemistry of Hell resolve</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller">OUT INTO THE VOID</span></h3>

</div>

<p>So it was all over.</p>

<p>Had she been the dupe of malicious gods? Yes,
if within that malign pantheon there was a throne
for her old enemy, <i>Amour-Propre</i>. For it was <i>Amour-Propre</i>
that had played her this scurvy trick and had
upset her poor little boat ‘drifting oarless on a full
sea’—not of Grace but of Chance. After all, Jansenism,
Cartesianism, her mother’s philosophy of indifference,
had all the same aim—to give a touch of sea-craft to
the poor human sailor, and to flatter him with the
belief that some harbour lies before him. But they
lie, they lie! There is no port, no rudder, no stars,
and the frail fleet of human souls is at the mercy of
every wind that blows.</p>

<p>She laughed bitterly when she remembered her
certainty of her own election, her anger against the
mighty hands slowly, surely, torturing her life into
salvation. She laughed still more at her faith in a
kind, heavenly Father, a rock in a weary land, a certain
caterer of lovely gifts. How had she ever been fool
enough to believe in this? Had she no eyes for the
countless proofs all round her that any awful thing
might happen to any one? People, just as real and
alive as she was herself, were disfigured by smallpox,
or died of plague, or starved in the streets, or loved
without being loved in return; and yet, she had
wrapped herself round in an imaginary ghostly tenderness,
certain in her foolish heart that it was against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
the order of the universe that such things should
happen to <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>And as to Mademoiselle de Scudéry, she knew that
the whole business had been a foolish <i>vision</i>, a little
seed growing to grotesque dimensions in a sick brain,
and yet this knowledge was powerless to stem the
mad impetus of her misery.</p>

<p>How she longed for Jacques during these days, for
his comforting hands, his <i>allégresse</i>, his half-mocking
patience. She saw him, pale and chestnut-haired
with his light, mysterious, beckoning eyes—so strangely
like the picture by Da Vinci in the Louvre of Saint
John the Baptist—marching head erect to his bright
destiny down the long white roads of France, and he
would never come back.</p>

<p>And yet, she had hinted to Madame Pilou that the
fable of the dog and the shadow is the epitome of all
tragedy. Somewhere inside her had she always known
what must happen?</p>

<p>First, this time of faultless vision. And then, because—though
hope was dead—there still remained ‘the
adamant of desire,’ she began once more to dance.
But with hope were cut the cables binding her to
reality, and it was out into the void that she danced
now.</p>

<p class="book">Cousin Philip</p>

<p class="author">MRS HUMPHRY WARD</p>

<p>Author of <i>The War and Elizabeth</i>, <i>Missing</i>, etc.</p>

<p class="desc"><i>Cousin Philip</i> is chiefly a study of the change which
the war has brought about, on the modern girl and the
relations of men and women. Helena, an orphan girl of
great beauty and some wealth, has consented, to please
her dying mother, to spend two years, from her 19th to
her 21st birthday, under the care of her guardian, Lord
Buntingford, rather than go at once, as she herself wishes,
to a University, in preparation for an independent life.
She is headstrong, wilful, and clever; as keen intellectually
as she is fond of dancing and flirting. Mrs Humphry
Ward shows all her well-known skill in the handling of
the subsequent situation, that skill which has made her
books models of the novel writer’s art. Lord Buntingford’s
modern yet chivalrous character, with his poetic
personality, make him a charming figure. The <i>dénouement</i>
is unexpected.</p>

<p class="book">The Young Physician</p>

<p class="author">FRANCIS BRETT YOUNG</p>

<p>Author of <i>Marching on Tanga</i>, etc.</p>

<p class="desc"><i>The Young Physician</i> is the history of the formative
years of a boy who, after leaving one of our public
schools, decides more from force of circumstances than
from inclination to enter the medical profession. Side-light
is thrown upon our educational system in the
first part of the book, which is devoted to home and
school life; while in the second, the impressions and
experiences which went to the moulding of his character
are presented side by side with a picture of student life
at the Midland Hospital where he pursues his medical
curriculum. The success of such a book lies no less in
its truth to life than its ability to entertain the reader,
both of which conditions are fulfilled in Major Brett
Young’s new novel where, once again, the author breaks
entirely new ground.</p>

<p class="book">New Wine</p>

<p class="author">AGNES <span class="smcap">and</span> EGERTON CASTLE</p>

<p class="desc">The authors of <i>Rose of the World</i> and of <i>Minniglen</i> take
an unsophisticated, high-spirited young man from peasant
surroundings on the west coast of Ireland and plunge
him in the whirl of fashionable English life—the unexpected
inheritor of affluence and honours. It is the
‘new wine’ put into ‘old bottles.’ There is strong
romance in the story, although the scenes and the
characters are literally up-to-date. The drama, however,
is throughout essentially one of the soul—that of
a generous, heady youth confronted by passionate
problems and ignorant of worldly conventions.</p>

<p class="book">The Plain Girl’s Tale</p>

<p class="author">H. H. BASHFORD</p>

<p class="desc"><i>The Plain Girl’s Tale</i>, by H. H. Bashford, is the longest
novel that the author of <i>The Corner of Harley Street</i>
has yet written, and the first that he has produced since
the publication of <i>Pity the Poor Blind</i>, six years ago.
Though dealing with the adventures and development
of a girl of the artisan class in various spheres of contemporary
life, it stands apart from the war and is in
no sense merely topical. In the delineation of the central
character, through whose eyes most of the action of the
novel is seen, the author has endeavoured to expand the
ethical theme that was the basis of his previous novel.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Extra Crown 8vo. 7s. 6d. net.</i></p>

<p class="book">The Sword of Love</p>

<p class="author">MORAY DALTON</p>

<p class="desc">This is a romance of Italy in the golden days of the
revival of art and learning. It tells how Marco Landi,
going in search of his little half-sister Fiore, came to the
Court of Lorenzo—The Magnificent—and was involved
in the tragic adventure of the Pazzi Conspiracy.</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
